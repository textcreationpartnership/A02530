            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of a brother; Yea, this latter ≈øin was therefore the le≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe that brother was worthy of death, though by another hand; whereas that ≈øi≈øter was guilty of nothing but mode≈øt beauty: yet he that knew this rape pa≈ø≈øed ouer (whole two yeeres) with impunity, dares not tru≈øt the mercy of a father, in the pardon of his murder; but for threeyeers, hides his head in the Court of his Grand-father, the King of Ge≈øhur.

                  <p>The Parents of Chri≈øt went vp yearely to Ieru≈øalem at the fea≈øt of the Pa≈ø≈øouer; the law was onely for the males, I doe not finde the ble≈ø≈øed virgin bound to this voyage, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ≈øexe receiued indulgence from God: yet ≈øhee knowing the ≈øpirituall profit of that iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, takes paines voluntarily to mea≈øure that long way euery yeare; Piety regards not any di≈øtinction of ≈øexes or degrees, nether yet doth Gods acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; rather doth it plea≈øe the mercy of the highe≈øt, more to reward that ≈øeruice, which, though he like in all, yet out of fauour he will not impo≈øe vpon

                  <p>It was the fa≈øhion of tho≈øe times and places, that they went vp, and ≈øo returned by troupes, to tho≈øe ≈øet meetings of their holy fe≈øtiuals.

Sometimes the affaires of our ordinary vocation, may not grudge to yeeld vnto ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall occa≈øions: The Parents of Chri≈øt knew him well, to be of a di≈øpo≈øition, not ≈øtrange, nor ≈øullen and ≈øtoycall, but ≈øweet and ≈øociable: and therfore they ≈øuppo≈øed, he had ≈øpent the time and the way, in the company of their frends and neighbours: They doe not ≈øu≈øpect him wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred into the ≈øolitary fields, but when euening came, they go to ≈øeeke him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance: If hee had not wonted to conuer≈øe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly with them, hee had not now beene ≈øought among≈øt them: Neither as God, nor man

doth he take plea≈øure in a ≈øterne froward au≈øterity, and wilde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredne≈ø≈øe: but in a milde affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈ø≈øe, and amiable conuer≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation.</p>

                  <p>This very poore hou≈øe, was furni≈øhed with many and large ve≈ø≈øels, for outward purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; As if ≈øin had dwelt vpon the skin, that ≈øuper≈øtitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ≈øought holine≈ø≈øe in frequent

our ≈øtomachs? If there bee no remedy, wee could haue ≈øought this ≈øupply vnbidden; yet ≈øo far hath the charge of Chri≈øts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preuailed, that in ≈øteede of carrying flagons of wine to the table, they goe to fetch pailes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of water from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øternes.

                  <p>Hee that could haue created wine immediately in tho≈øe ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, will rather turne water into wine; In all the cour≈øe of his mitacles, I doe neuer finde him making out of nothing; all his great workes are grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on former exi≈øtences; he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed the bread, hee changed

the water, he re≈øtored the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lims, hee ray≈øed the dead; and ≈øtill wrought vpon that which was, and did not make that which was not: What doth he in the ordinary way of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but turne the watery iuyce that ari≈øes vp from the root, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wine; he will onely doe this now ≈øuddenly, and at once, which he doth v≈øually by in≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible degrees.

                  <p>How liberall are the proui≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chri≈øt? If he had turned but one of tho≈øe ve≈ø≈øels, it had beene a iu≈øt proofe of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and perhaps that quantity

had ≈øerued the pre≈øent nece≈ø≈øity; now hee furni≈øheth them with ≈øo much wine, as would haue ≈øerued an hundred and fifty gue≈øts for an intire ≈øea≈øt; Euen the mea≈øure magnifies at once, both his power and mercy. The munificent hand of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not our neede onely, but our hone≈øt affluence: It is our ≈øin and our ≈øhame, if wee turne his fauour into wantonne≈ø≈øe.

                  <p>Our Sauiour would not bee his owne ta≈øter, but he ≈øends the

Our wealth, beauty, wit, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, honor may make vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of men, but it is our faith only, that ≈øhall make God in loue with vs; And why are we of any other ≈øaue Gods diet, to bee more affected with the lea≈øt mea≈øure of grace in any man, then withall the outward glories of the world?
