            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19686:7"/>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> had newly ſmitten in Keilah, call off <hi>Saul</hi> from ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Dauid</hi> in the wilderneſſe, when there was but an hillock betwixt him and death: Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purpoſes are eaſily checked, not eaſily broken off. <hi>Sauls</hi> ſword is ſcarce dry from the bloud of the Philiſtims, when it thirſts anew for the bloud of <hi>Dauid;</hi> and now in a renued chaſe, hunts him dry-foot tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row euery wilderneſſe: The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſert is too faire a refuge for innocence; The hils and rocks are ſearched in an angry iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; the very wilde goats of the mountaines were not allowed to bee companions for him, which had no fault but his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19686:7"/>
Oh the ſeemingly-vnequall diſtribution of theſe earthly things; Cruelty and oppreſſion raignes in a palace, whiles good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lurkes among the rockes and caues, and thinkes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe enough to ſteale a life.</p>
                  <p>Like a dead man, <hi>Dauid</hi> is faine to be hid vnder the earth, and ſeekes the comfort of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in darkneſſe: and now the wiſe prouidence of God leads <hi>Saul</hi> to his enemy without bloud; He, which before broght them within an hils diſtance without interview, brings them now both within one roofe; ſo as that whiles <hi>Saul</hi> ſeekes <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and findes him not, hee is found of <hi>Dauid</hi> vnſought. If

                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:19686:8"/>
It is not long, ſince <hi>Saul</hi> ſayd of <hi>Dauid</hi> (lodged them in Kei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah) God hath deliuered him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mine hands, for he is ſhut in, ſeeing hee is come into a City that hath gates and bars; but now contrarily God deliuers <hi>Saul</hi> (ere he was aware) into the hands of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and without the helpe of gates and bars, hath incloſed him within the valley of the ſhadow of death: How iuſt it is with God, that thoſe who ſeeke miſcheefe to others, finde it to them ſelues; and euen whiles they are ſpredding nets, are inſnared; Their deliberate plotting of euill, is ſurprized with a ſudden judgement.</p>
                  <p>How amazedly muſt <hi>Dauid</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:19686:9"/>
needes looke, when he ſaw <hi>Saul</hi> enter into the caue, where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was? what is this (thinkes hee) which God hath done? Is this preſence purpoſed, or caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; is <hi>Saul</hi> here to purſue, or to tempt me? Where ſuddenly the action bewrayes the intent, and tels <hi>Dauid</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> ſought ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and not him. The ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of his maliciouſneſſe brought him into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the neceſſity of nature led him into the caue: Euen thoſe actions wherin we place ſhame, are not exempted from a proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The fingers of <hi>Dauids</hi> followers itched to ceaſe on their Maſters enemy; and that they might not ſeeme led ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19686:9"/>
much by faction, as by faith, they vrge <hi>Dauid</hi> with a promiſe from God; The day is come whereof the Lord ſaid vnto thee, Behold I will deliuer thine enemie into thine hand, and thou ſhalt do to him, as it ſhall ſeeme good to thee. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemed to carry ſuch command with it, as that <hi>Dauid</hi> not onely may, but muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue his hands in blood, vnleſſe he will bee found wanting to God and himſelfe, thoſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are moſt powerfull, which fetch their force from the pretence of a religious obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Whereas thoſe which are rayſed from arbitrary and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reſpects, admit of an eaſie diſpenſation.</p>

                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:19686:10"/>
If there were ſuch a prediction, one clauſe of it was ambiguous; and they take it at the worſt: Thou ſhalt doe to him as ſhall ſeeme good to thee: that might not ſeeme good to him, which ſeemed euill vnto God. There is nothing more dangerous then to make conſtruction of Gods purpoſes out of euentuall appearances, If carnall proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities might be the rule of our iudgement, what could God ſeeme to intend other then <hi>Sauls</hi> death in offering him naked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of thoſe whom he vniuſtly perſecuted? how could <hi>Dauids</hi> ſoldiers thinke that God had ſent <hi>Saul</hi> thither on any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther errand, then to fetch his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19686:10"/>
bane, and if <hi>Saul</hi> could haue ſeene his owne danger, hee had giuen himſelfe for dead, for his hart guilty to his owne bloody deſires could not but haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the ſame meaſure which is meant: But wiſe and holy <hi>Dauid</hi> not tranſported either with miſconcert of the euent, or fury of paſſion, or ſollicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his followers dares make no other vſe of this accident then the triall of his loyalty, and the inducement of his peace; It had beene as eaſie for him to cut the throate of <hi>Saul</hi> as his garment; but now his coate only ſhall be the worſe, not his perſon; neither doth he in the moyming of a cloake ſeeke his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19686:11"/>
own reuenge, but a monument of his innocence. Before <hi>Saul</hi> rent <hi>Samuels</hi> garment, now <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> cutteth <hi>Sauls;</hi> both were ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant; The rending of the one, ſignified the Kingdome torne out of thoſe vnworthy hands; the cutting of the other, that the life of <hi>Saul</hi> might haue beene as eaſily cut off.</p>

                     <hi>Saul</hi> needs no other monitor of his owne danger, then what he weares. The vpper garment of <hi>Saul</hi> was laid aſide, whiles he went to couer his feete; ſo as the cut of the garment, did not threaten any touch of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet euen this violence offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a remote garment ſtrikes the hart of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which findes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19686:11"/>
a preſent remorſe for harmeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching, that which did once touch the perſon of his maiſter, Tender conſciences are moued to regret at thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſtrong harts paſſe ouer with a careleſſe eaſe. It troubled not <hi>Saul</hi> to ſeeke after the blood of a righteons ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant; there is no leſſe difference of conſciences then ſtomackes; Some ſtomacks will digeſt the hardeſt meates, and turne ouer ſubſtances, not in their nature edible, whiles others ſurret of the lighteſt food, and complaine euen of dainties: Euery gratious hart is in ſome meaſure ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and findes more ſafetie in feare, then in preſumption: And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19686:12"/>
if it be ſo ſtrait as to curbe it ſelfe in from the libertie which it might take in things which are not vnlawfull, how much leſſe will it dare to take ſcope vnto euill: By how much that ſtate is better, where nothing is allowed, then where all things; by ſo much is the ſtrict and timorous conſcience better then the lawleſſe. There is good likelyhood of that man which is any way ſcrupulous of his wayes; but he which makes no bones of his actions, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently hopeleſſe.</p>
                  <p>SINCE <hi>Dauids</hi> followers pleaded Gods teſtimony to him as a motiue to blood. <hi>Dauid</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales the ſame God for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19686:12"/>
from blood. The Lord keepe me from doing that thing to my maiſter the Lords anoynted; and now the good man hath worke enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend both himſelfe and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter, himſelfe, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate neceſſitie of doing violence, and his maiſter from ſuffering it. It was not more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to rule his owne hands, then difficult to rule a multitude: <hi>Dauids</hi> troupe conſiſted of male-contents, all, that were in diſtreſſe, in debt, in bitterneſſe of ſoule were gathered to him: Many if neuer ſo well ordered, are hard to command, a few if diſorderly, more hard; many and diſorderly muſt needes be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19686:13"/>
ſo much the hardeſt of all, that <hi>Dauid</hi> neuer atchiued any victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie like vnto this, wherein the firſt ouercame himſelfe, then his ſoldiers.</p>
                  <p>AND what was the charme, wherewith <hi>Dauid</hi> allayed thoſe raging ſpirits of his followers? No other but this; He is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted of the Lord. That ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyle was the Antidote for his blood; <hi>Saul</hi> did not lend <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo impearceable an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, when he ſhould incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Goliah,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> now lent him in this plea of his vnction. Which of all the diſconted out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes that lurked in that caue, durſt put forth his hand againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> when they once heard, He
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19686:13"/>
is the Lords anoynted: Such an impreſſion of awe hath the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence cauſed his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to make in the harts of men, as that it makes traytors cowards; So as inſteed of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king they tremble; How much more lawleſſe, then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes of Iſrael are thoſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ring-leaders of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which teach and practiſe, and incourage, and reward, and canonize the violation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. It is not enough for thoſe who are commanders of others to refraine their owne hands from euill, but they muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preuent the iniquitie of their heeles, elſe they ſhall bee iuſtly reputed to doe that by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19686:14"/>
others, which in their owne perſon they auoyded; the lawes both of God and man, preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vs in ſome ſort anſwerable for our charge: as taking it for granted, that wee ſhould not vndertake thoſe raynes, which we cannot mannage.</p>
                  <p>There was no reaſon <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhould looſe the thankes of ſo noble a demonſtration of his loyalty; Whereto he truſts ſo much, that hee dares call backe the man by whom he was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; and make him iudge whether that fact had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued a life. As his act, ſo his word and geſture imported nothing but humble obedience, neither was there more meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19686:14"/>
then force in that ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſwaſion; Wherein hee lets <hi>Saul</hi> ſee the error of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, the vniuſt ſlaunders of maliciouſneſſe, the oportunity of his reuenge, the proofe of his forbearance, the vndeniable euidence of his innocence; and after a lowly diſparagement of himſelfe, appeales to God for iudgement, for protection.</p>
                  <p>So liuely and feeling oratory did <hi>Saul</hi> finde in the lap of his garment, and the lips of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that it is not in the power of his enuy, or ill nature to hold out any longer. Is this thy voyce my ſonne <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> lift vp his voyce and wept, and ſaid: Thou art more righteous
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19686:15"/>
then I; Hee, whoſe harpe had wont to quiet the frenzy of <hi>Saul,</hi> hath now by his words calmed his fury; ſo as now hee ſheds teares in ſteed of blood: and confeſſes his owne wrong, and <hi>Dauids</hi> integrity; And (as if he were new againe entered into the bounds of <hi>Naioth</hi> in Ramath) he prayes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies good to him, whom he maliced for good; The Lord render thee good for that thou haſt done to mee this day; for now behold I know that thou ſhalt be king. There is no hart made of fleſh, that ſome time or other relents not, euen flint and marble, will in ſome wether ſtand on dropes. I cannot think
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19686:15"/>
theſe teares and proteſtations fayned. Doubtleſſe <hi>Saul</hi> meant as he ſaid, and paſſed through ſenſible fits of good and euill: Let no man like himſelfe the better for good motions; the prayſe and benefit of thoſe gueſts is not in the receit, but the retention.</p>
                  <p>Who, that had ſeene this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, could but haue thought all had beene ſure on <hi>Dauids</hi> ſide? What can ſecure vs if not teares, and prayers and oathes? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Dauids</hi> men which knew themſelues obnoxious to lawes and creditors, began to thinke of ſome new refuge, as making account this new peeced league would be euerlaſting; they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19686:16"/>
when <hi>Saul</hi> would take <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> home to the court, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue his army, and recompence that vniuſt perſecution with iuſt honor; when behold in the looſe, <hi>Saul</hi> goes home, but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and his men goe vp vnto the hold. Wiſe <hi>Dauid</hi> knowes <hi>Saul</hi> not to be more kinde, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſty; and therefore had rather ſeeke ſafely in his hold, then in the hold of an hollow and vnſteedy friendſhip. Heere are good words but no ſecurity, which therefore an experienced man giues the hearing, but ſtands the while vpon his own guard. No charity bindes vs to a truſt of thoſe, whom we haue found faithleſſe; Credulity
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19686:16"/>
vpon weake grounds after pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable diſapointments, is the daughter of folly: A man that is weatherwiſe, though he finde an abatement of the ſtorme, yet will not ſtirre from vnder his ſhelter whiles hee ſees it thicke in the winde, diſtruſt is the iuſt gaine of vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                  <p>THE liues of all his family were now in hazard: ſhe dares not commit this buſineſſe to the fidelity of a meſſenger, but forgetting her ſex, puts herſelfe into the errand; Her foot is not ſlow, her hand is not empty; According to the offence ſhee frames her ſatisfaction; Her husband refuſed to giue, ſhee brings a bountiful gift; her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band

There is the ſame way to our peace in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; the only meanes to eſcape judgement, is to complaine of our owne vileneſſe; ſhee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her ignorance of the fact, and therein, her freedome from the offence; ſhe humbly craueth acceptation of her preſent, with pardon of the fault; ſhe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>Dauids</hi> honorable acts and merits; ſhee foretels his future ſucceſſe and glory; ſhe layes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the happy peace of his

bee ſo affected with a danger paſt, and yet ſo ſenceleſſe of a future, yea imminent? He that was yeſter-night as a beaſt, is now as a ſtone; hee was then ouer-merry, now dead and lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh; Carnall hearts are euer in extremity. If they bee once downe, their deſection is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, becauſe they haue no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort, to mitigate their ſorrow; What difference there was betwixt the diſpoſition of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Nabal?</hi> How oft had <hi>Dauid</hi> beene in the valley of the ſhadow of death, and feared no euill? <hi>Nabal</hi> is but once put in minde of a death that might haue been, and is ſtricken dead.</p>
                  <p>It is juſt with God, that they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19686:27"/>
who liue without grace, ſhould dye without comfort; neither can we expect better, while wee goe on in our ſins. The ſpeech of <hi>Abigail</hi> ſmote <hi>Nabal</hi> into a qualme; that tongue had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe oft aduiſed him well, and preuailed not; now, occaſions his death, whoſe reformation it could not effect; ſhee meant nothing but his amendment; God meant to make that louing Inſtrument the meanes of his reuenge: ſhe ſpeakes, and God ſtrikes; within ten dayes, that ſwound ends in death. And now <hi>Nabal</hi> payes deare for his vncharitable reproch; for his riotous exceſſe; That God, which would not ſuffer <hi>Dauid</hi> to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19686:28"/>
right himſelfe by his owne ſword, takes the quarrell of his Seruant into his owne hand, <hi>Dauid</hi> hath now his ends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; reioycing in the juſt executions of God, who would neither ſuffer him to ſinne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging, nor ſuffer his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſin vnreuenged.</p>
                  <p>Our louing God is more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the wrongs done to his ſeruants, then themſelues can be, and knowes how to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh that juſtly, which we could not vndertake with wronging God, more then men haue wronged vs. He that ſaith, <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine, I will repay,</hi> repayes oft-times when we haue forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, when we haue forgotten;

                  <p>How farre God lookes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our purpoſes? <hi>Abigail</hi> came only to plead for an ill husband; and now God makes this iourney a preparation for a better; So that in one act, ſhee preſerud an ill husband, and wonne a good one for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>Dauid</hi> well remembers her comely perſon, her wife ſpeeches, her gracefull carriage; and now, when modeſty found it ſeaſonable; he ſendes to ſue to her, which had beene his ſuppliant; ſhe intreated for her
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19686:29"/>
husband, <hi>Dauid</hi> treates with her for his wife; her requeſt was to eſcape his ſword, hee wiſheth her to his bed; It was a faire ſuite to change a <hi>Dauid</hi> for a <hi>Nabal;</hi> to become <hi>Dauids</hi> Queene, in ſteed of <hi>Nabals</hi> drudge; ſhee that learned hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie vnder ſo hard a Tuter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſeth her ſelfe no leſſe when <hi>Dauid</hi> offers to aduance her; (Let thine hand-maid be a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to waſh the feet of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of my Lord) None are ſo fit to be great, as thoſe that can ſtoope loewſt: How could <hi>Dauid</hi> be more happy in a wife; he finds at once piety, wiſdom, humility, faithfulnes, wealth, beauty?

Thoſe that would ſtand ſure, muſt not affect too much height, or conſpicuity; The tall Cedars are moſt ſubiect to winds and lightnings, whiles the ſhrubs of the valleyes ſtand vnmooued; Much greatneſſe doth but make a fairer marke for euill; There is true firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſafety in mediocrity.</p>

The interuention of a command from the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, alters the ſtate of any act; and makes that worthy of praiſe, which els were no better then damnable. It is now Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which were otherwiſe murder; The will of God is the rule of good; what neede we enquire into other reaſons,

                  <p>How many hundred yeeres had this brood of Cananites li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſecurely in their Country; ſince God commanded them to bee rooted out, and now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelues the certaineſt peace? The Philiſtims were their friends, if not their Lords; The Iſraelites had their hands full, neither did they know any grudge betwixt them and their neighbours, when ſuddenly the ſword of <hi>Dauid</hi> cuts them off, and leaues none aliue to tell the newes.</p>
                  <p>THERE is no ſafety in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; with men, delay cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

                  <p>MISERABLE were the ſtraits of <hi>Dauid;</hi> while he was driuen, not onely to maintaine his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by ſpoyle, but to colour his ſpoyle by a ſinfull diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; He tels <hi>Achiſh,</hi> that he had beene rouing againſt the South
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19686:38"/>
or Iudah, and the South of the Ierahmelites, and the South of the Kenites; either falſely, or doubtfully, ſo as hee meant to deceiue him, vnder whom hee liued, and by whom hee was truſted: If <hi>Achiſh</hi> were a Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtim, yet hee was <hi>Dauids</hi> frend, yea his Patron; and if hee had beene neither, it had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comne <hi>Dauid</hi> to bee falſe.

                  <p>How eaſily doe we beleeue

that which we wiſh; The more credit <hi>Achiſh</hi> giues vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> the more ſin it was to deceiue him. And now the conceit of this ingagement, procures him a further ſeruice. The Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims are aſſembled to fight with Iſrael; <hi>Achiſh</hi> dares truſt <hi>Dauid</hi> on his ſide; yea, to keepe his head for euer; neither can <hi>Dauid:</hi> do any leſſe then promiſe his ayd againſt his owne fleſh: Neuer was <hi>Dauid,</hi> in all his life, driuen to ſo hard an exigent: neuer was hee ſo extremely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed; For what ſhould he do now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To fight with <hi>Achiſh,</hi> he was tyed by promiſe, by merit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not to fight againſt Iſrael, hee was tyed by his calling, by his

vnction; Not to fight for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſh,</hi> were to bee vnthankfull; To fight againſt Iſrael, were to be vnnaturall; Oh what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward battle muſt <hi>Dauid</hi> needes haue in his breſt, when he thinks of this battle of Iſrael, and the Philiſtims; How doth he wiſh now, that hee had rather ſtood to the hazard of <hi>Sauls</hi> perfecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then to haue put himſelfe vpon the fauour of <hi>Achiſh;</hi> He muſt fight on one ſide, and on whether ſide ſoeuer hee ſhould fight, he could not auoyd to be treacherous; a condition worſe then death, to an honeſt heart; which way hee would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, if it had comne to the execution, who can know, ſince
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19686:39"/>
himſelfe was doubtfull? either courſe had beene no better then deſperate. How could the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites euer haue receiued him for their King, who in the open field, had fought againſt them? And contrarily, if hee would haue fought againſt his frend, for his enemy; againſt <hi>Achiſh</hi> for <hi>Saul,</hi> he was now inuironed with jealous Philiſtims; and might rather looke for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his treaſon, then the glory of a victory.</p>
                  <p>HIS heart had led him into theſe ſtraits; the Lord findes a way to lead him out: The ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of his enemies do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in befrend him; The Princes of the Philiſtims (whether of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19686:40"/>
or ſuſpition) plead for <hi>Dauids</hi> diſmiſſion, <hi>(Send this fellow back, that he may goe againe to his place, which thou haſt appoynted him, and let him not goe downe to the battle, leſt he be an aduerſary to vs.)</hi> No aduocate could haue ſaid more, himſelfe durſt not haue ſayd ſo much. Oh the wiſdome, and goodneſſe of our God, that can raiſe vp an aduerſary to deliuer out of thoſe euils, which our frends cannot; That by the ſword of an enemy, can let out that apoſtume, which no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician could tell how to cure: It would be wide with vs ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if it were not for others malice.</p>
                  <p>There could not bee a more

juſt queſtion, then this of the Philiſtim Princes, <hi>What doe theſe Hebrewes here?</hi> An Iſraelite is out of his element, when he is in an army of Philiſtims: The true ſeruants of God are in their due places, when they are in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his enemies. Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hoſtility becomes them better then leagues of amity.</p>
                  <p>YET <hi>Achiſh</hi> likes <hi>Dauids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation and preſence ſo well, that he profeſſeth himſelfe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, as with an Angell of God; How ſtrange it is to heare, that a Philiſtim ſhould delight in that holy man, whom an Iſraelite abhors, and ſhould be loth to be quit of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> whom <hi>Saul</hi> hath expelled.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19686:41"/>
Termes of ciuility be equally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all religions, to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions: The common graces of Gods children, are able to attract loue from the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate enemies of goodneſſe; If we affect them for by-reſpects of valour, wiſdome, diſcourſe, wit, it is their praiſe, not ours, But if for diuine grace and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is our praiſe with theirs.</p>
                  <p>SVCH now was <hi>Dauids</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that hee muſt plead for that he feared, and argue againſt that which hee deſired: <hi>(What haue I done? and what hast thou found in thy ſeruant, that I may not goe, and fight againſt the enemies of my Lord the King?)</hi> Neuer any newes could bee more cordiall

                  <p>Where is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no place for holy feare, there will be place for the ſeruile; The graceleſſe heart of <hi>Saul</hi> was aſtonied at the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims; yet was neuer moued at the frowns of that God, whoſe anger ſent them, nor of thoſe ſinnes of his, which procured
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19686:43"/>
them. Thoſe that cannot feare for loue, ſhall tremble for feare: and how much better is awe then terror? preuention then confuſion? There is nothing more lamentable to ſee a man laugh when hee ſhould feare; God ſhall laugh when ſuch a ones feare commeth:</p>
                  <p>Extremiry of diſtreſſe, will ſend euen the prophaneſt man to God; like as the drowning man, reacheth out his hand to that bow, which he contemned whiles hee ſtood ſafe on the banke; <hi>Saul</hi> now asketh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Lord; whoſe Prophet he hated, whoſe prieſts he ſlue, whoſe anoynted he perſecutes; Had <hi>Saul</hi> conſulted with God
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19686:43"/>
when he ſhould, this euill had not beene; but now, if this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill had not beene; he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with God; The thanke of this act is due, not him, but to his affection; A forced piety is thankeleſſe, and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; God will not anſwere him neither by dreames, nor by v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, nor by Prophets. Why ſhould God anſwer, that man by dreames, who had reſiſted him waking? Why ſhould he anſwer him by vrim, that had ſlaine his Prieſts? Why ſhould he anſwer him by Prophets, who hated the Father of the Prophets, rebelled againſt the word of the Prophets?</p>
                  <p>It is an vnreaſonable vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:19686:44"/>
to hope to finde God at our command, when wee would not be at his; To looke that God ſhould regard our voyce in trouble, when wee would not regard his, in peace.</p>
                  <p>Vnto what mad ſhiftes are men driuen by deſpaire? If God will not anſwer, Satan ſhall; <hi>(Saul</hi> ſaid to his ſeruants, ſeeke me a woman that hath a famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar ſpirit) If <hi>Saul</hi> had not known this courſe Diueliſh, why did he decree to baniſh it, to mulct it with death? yet now againſt the ſtreame of his conſcience, he will ſeeke to thoſe whom he had condemned; There needs no other iudge of <hi>Sauls</hi> act then himſelfe; had hee not before
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:19686:44"/>
oppoſed this ſinne, he had not ſo haynouſly ſinned in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it; There cannot bee a more fearefull ſigne of an heart giuen vp to a reprobate ſence, then to caſt it ſelfe wilfully into thoſe ſinnes, which it hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to deteſt. The declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to euill are many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, but when it breakes forth into ſuch apparant effects, euen others eies may diſcerne it; What was <hi>Saul</hi> the better to fore-know the iſſue of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching battaile? If this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation could haue ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him againſt his enemies, or promoted his victory, there might haue bene ſome colour for ſo foule an act; Now, what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19686:45"/>
could hee gaine, but the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his bootleſſe curioſity; in fore-ſeeing that, which hee ſhould not be able to auoyd?</p>
                  <p>Fooliſh men giue a way their ſoules for nothing; The itch of impertinent and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable knowledge, hath beene the heriditary diſtroyer of the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue;</hi> How many haue periſhed to know that which hath procured their periſhing? How ambitious ſhould wee bee to know thoſe things, the knowledge wherof is eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Many a leud office are they put to; which ſerue wicked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; one while <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeruants are ſet to kill innocent <hi>Dauid;</hi>

another while, to ſhed the blood of Gods Prieſts; and now they muſt goe ſeeke for a Witch: It is no ſmall happineſſe to attend them, from whom we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue precepts and examples of vertue.</p>
                  <p>Had <hi>Saul</hi> bene good, he had needed no diſguiſe; Honeſt actions neuer ſhame the doers; Now that hee goeth about a ſinfull buſineſſe, hee changeth himſelfe; he ſeekes the ſhelter of the night, he takes but two followers with him; It is true, that if <hi>Saul</hi> had comne in the port of a King, the Witch had as much diſſembled her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as now he diſſembleth his; yet it was not only deſire to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19686:46"/>
ſpeed, but guiltineſſe that thus altred his habit; ſuch is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of conſcience, that euen thoſe who are moſt affected to euill, yet are aſhamed to bee thought ſuch as they deſire to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> needed another face to fit that tongue, which ſhould ſay (Coniecture to me by the familiar ſpirit, and bring me vp whom I ſhall name vnto thee;) An obdurate heart can giue way to any thing:</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory edict of <hi>Saul,</hi> there are ſtill Witches in Iſrael: Neither good lawes nor carefull execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, can purge the Church from Malefactors; There will ſtill be ſome that will ieopard

their heads vpon the groſſeſt ſins; No garden can bee ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly tended, that there ſhould not be one weed left in it. Yet ſo farre can good ſtatutes, and due inflictions of puniſhment vpon offenders, preuaile that miſcheeuous perſons are glad to pull in their heads; and dare not doe ill, but in diſguiſe and darkneſſe. It is no ſmall aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Iuſtice, that it affrights ſin, if it cannot be expelled; As contrarily, wofull is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that place, where is a publique profeſſion of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                  <p>No ſooner hath <hi>Saul</hi> ſworne her ſafety, then ſhee addreſſeth her to her ſorcery; Hope of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity drawes on ſinne with boldneſſe; were it not for the deluſions of falſe promiſes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhould haue no Clients. Could <hi>Saul</hi> be ſo ignorant, as to thinke that Magick had power ouer Gods deceaſed Saints, to raiſe them vp; yea, to call them downe from their reſt? Time was, when <hi>Saul</hi> was among the Prophets. And yet now, that

he is in the impure lodg of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, how ſenceleſſe he is, to ſay, <hi>Bring me vp Samuel?</hi> It is no rare thing, to loſe euen our wit and judgement together with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; How juſtly are they giuen ouer to ſottiſhneſſe, that haue giuen themſelues ouer to ſin?</p>
                  <p>The Sorcereſſe (it ſeemes) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing her coniurations in a roome apart, is informed by her Familiar, who it was that ſet her on worke; ſhee can therefore finde time, in the midſt of her exorciſmes, to binde the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of her owne ſafety, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation, <hi>Shee cryed with a loud voyce, Why haſt thou deceiued mee, for thou art Saul,)</hi> The very name of <hi>Saul</hi> was an accuſation; Yet
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19686:48"/>
is hee ſo far from ſtriking his breſt, that doubting leſt this feare of the Witch, ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the deſired worke, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages her, whom he ſhould haue condemned; <hi>(Be not afraid;)</hi> He that had more cauſe to feare, for his owne ſake, in an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſt judgement, cheeres vp her, that feared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing but himſelfe: How ill doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vs, to giue that counſell to others, whereof wee haue more need and vſe in our owne perſons?</p>
                  <p>As one that had more care to ſatisfie his curioſity, then her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion, he asks, <hi>What ſaweſt thou?</hi> Who would not haue looked, that <hi>Sauls</hi> haire ſhould haue ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19686:49"/>
on his head, to heare of a ſpirit raiſed? His ſinne hath ſo hardened him, that hee rather pleaſes himſelfe in it, which hath nothing in it but horror; So far is Satan content to deſcend to the ſeruice of his ſeruants, that he will approue his fained obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their very outward ſences; What forme is ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that hee either cannot, or dare not vndertake? Here Gods aſcend out of the earth; Elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where Satan transformes him into an Angell of light; What wonder is it, that his wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments appeare like Saints in their hypocriticall diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If wec will bee iudging by the appearance, we ſhall be ſure
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19686:49"/>
to erre: No eie could diſtinguiſh betwixt the true <hi>Samuel,</hi> and a falſe ſpirit. <hi>Saul,</hi> who was well worthy to bee deceiued, ſeeing thoſe gray haires, and that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, inclines himſelfe to the ground, and bowes himſelfe; Hee that would not worſhip God in <hi>Samuel</hi> aliue, now wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips <hi>Samuel</hi> in Satan; and no meruel; Satan was now become his refuge in ſtead of God; his <hi>Vrim</hi> was darkneſſe, his Prophet a Ghoſt: Euery one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults with Satan, worſhips him, though hee bow not, neither doth that euill ſpirit deſire any other reuerence, then to bee ſought to.</p>
                  <p>How cunningly doth Satan
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19686:50"/>
reſemble, not onely the habit and geſture, but the language of <hi>Samuel, Wherefore haſt thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted me, and wherefore doeſt thou aske of mee, ſeeing the Lord is gone from thee, and is thine enemy?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin is more pleaſing to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill one, then to be ſolicited, yet in the perſon of <hi>Samuel,</hi> hee can ſay, <hi>Why haſt thou diſquieted mee?</hi> Had not the Lord beene gone from <hi>Saul,</hi> he had neuer comne to the diuelliſh Oracle of Endor, and yet the counterfetting ſpirit can ſay, <hi>Why doſt thou aske of mee, ſeeing the Lord is gone from thee?</hi> Satan cares not how little he is knowne to bee himſelfe; hee loues to paſſe vnder any forme, rather then his owne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:19686:50"/>
The more holy the perſon is, the more carefully doth Satan act him, that by his ſtale he may enſnare vs. In euery motion it is good to try the ſpirits, whether they bee of God; Good words are no meanes, to diſtinguiſh a Prophet from a Deuill; <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelfe, whiles hee was aliue, could not haue ſpoken more grauely, more ſeuerely, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely, then this euill Ghoſt, <hi>For the Lord will rent thy Kingdome out of thy hand, and giue it thy neighbour Dauid, becauſe thou obeyedst not the voyce of the Lord, nor executedſt his fierce wrath vpon the Amalekites, therefore hath the Lord done this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee this day:</hi> When the Diuell himſelfe puts on grauity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19686:51"/>
who can maruell at the hypocriſie of men? Well may lewd men bee good Preachers, when Satan himſelfe can play the Prophet; Where are thoſe Ignorants, that thinke charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of charmes and ſpels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they finde nothing in them, but good words? What Prophet could ſpeake better words, then this Diuell in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> mantle? Neither is there at any time ſo much danger of that wicked ſpirit, as when hee ſpeakes beſt.</p>
                  <p>I could wonder to heare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan preach thus prophetically, if I did not know, that as he was once a good Angell, ſo hee can ſtill act what hee was; Whiles
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19686:51"/>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> was in conſultation of ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Agag,</hi> we ſhall neuer finde that Satan would lay any block in his way; Yea, then he was a prompt Orator, to induce him into that ſin; now that it is paſt &amp; gone; he can lade <hi>Saul</hi> with fearfull denunciations of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Till wee haue ſinn'd, Satan is a Paraſite, when wee haue ſinn'd, hee is a Tyrant: What cares hee to flatter any more, when hee hath what hee would? Now his onely worke is to terrifie, and confound, that hee may enioy what hee hath won; How much better is it ſeruing that Maſter, who when wee are moſt deiected with the conſcience of euill, heartens

                  <p>It was a wofull ſpectacle for <hi>Dauid</hi> and his Souldiers, vpon their returne to finde ruines and aſhes in ſteed of houſes, and in ſteed of their families, ſolitude; Their citie was vaniſhed into ſmoake, their houſholds into captiuity; neither could they know whom to accuſe, or where to enquire for redreſſe; whiles they made account that their home ſhould recompence their tedious journey with comfort, the miſerable deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

his God; hee knew that though no mortall eye of reaſon; or ſenſe could diſcerne any euaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from theſe intricate euils, yet that the eye of diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had deſcryed it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and that though no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power could make way for his ſafety, yet that the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand of his God, could doe it with eaſe; His experience had aſſured him of the fidelity of his Guardian in heauen; and therfore he comforted himſelfe in the Lord his God.</p>
                  <p>In uaine is comfort expected from God, if wee conſult not with him. <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt is called for; <hi>Dauid</hi> was not in the court of <hi>Achiſh,</hi> without the

joynts vnto a new taske of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; It is no maruell, if two hundred of them were ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred, with their former toyle, that they were not able to paſſe ouer the riuer Beſor. <hi>Dauid</hi> was a true type of Chriſt. We follow him in theſe holy wars, againſt the ſpirituall Amalekites. All of vs are not of an equall ſtrength; Some are carried by the vigour of their faith, through all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; Others, after long preſſure, are ready to languiſh in the way; Our Leader is not more ſtrong then pittifull; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth hee ſcornfully caſhier thoſe, whoſe deſires are hearty, whiles their abilities are vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable; How much more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19686:59"/>
ſhould our charity pardon the infirmities of our brethen; and allow them to ſit by the ſtuffe, who cannot endure the march?</p>
                  <p>The ſame Prouidence, which appoynted <hi>Dauid</hi> to follow the Amalekites; had alſo ordered an Aegyptian to be caſt behinde them. This caſt ſeruant, whom his cruell Maſter, had left to faintneſſe and famine, ſhall bee vſed as the meanes of the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the Iſraelites loſſe; and of the reuenge of the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites. Had not his Maſter neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected him, all theſe rouers of Amalek, had gone away with their life and booty; It is not ſafe to deſpiſe the meaneſt vaſſal

                  <p>Charity diſtinguiſheth an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite from an Amalekite. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> followers are ſtrangers to this Aegyptian; an Amalekite was his Maſter; His Maſter leaues him to dye (in the field) of ſickneſſe and hunger; theſe ſtrangers releeued him: and ere they know, whether they might by him receiue any light in their purſuit, they refreſh his dying ſpirits with bread and water, with figs and raiſins; Neither can the haſte of their way bee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19686:60"/>
any hindrance to their compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; Hee hath no Iſraelitiſh blood in him, that is vtterly mercileſſe; Perhaps, yet <hi>Dauids</hi> Followers might alſo, in the hope of ſome intelligence, ſhew kindneſſe to this forlorne Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian. Worldly wiſdome tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, to ſow ſmall courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, where we may reape large harueſts of recompence: No ſooner are his ſpirits recalled, then hee requites his food with information. I cannot blame the Aegyptian, that hee was ſo eaſily induced, to deſcry theſe vnkind Amalekites, to merciful Iſraelites; thoſe that gaue him ouer vnto death, to the reſtorers of his life; much leſſe, that ere
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19686:60"/>
he would deſcry them; hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an oath of ſecurity, from ſo bad a Maſter; Well doth hee match death with ſuch a ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; Wonderfull is the Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God; euen ouer thoſe, which are not in the neereſt bonds, his owne; Three dayes, and three nights, had this poore Aegyptian Slaue lyen ſicke and hunger-ſtarued in the fields, and lookes for nothing but death, when God ſends him ſuccour from the hands of thoſe Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, whom hee had helped to ſpoile; though not ſo much for his ſake, as for Iſraels, is this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Stragler preſerued.</p>
                  <p>It pleaſes God, to extend his common fauors to all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:19686:61"/>
but in miraculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feruations; he hath ſtill wont to haue reſpect to his owne. By this means therfore, are the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites brought to the ſight of their late ſpoylers, whom they finde ſcattered abroad, vpon all the earth, eating, and drinking, and dancing in triumph, for the great prey they had taken.</p>
                  <p>It was three dayes at leaſt, ſince this gainefull forraging of Amalek; and now, ſeeing no feare of any Purſuer, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing themſelues ſafety, in ſo great and vntraced a diſtance, they make themſelues merry with ſo rich and eaſie a victory; and now ſuddenly, when they began to think of enioying the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19686:61"/>
beauty and wealth they had gotten; the ſword of <hi>Dauid</hi> was vpon their throats. Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is neuer neerer, then when ſecurity hath chaſed away feare. With how ſad faces and hearts, had the wiues of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the other Captiues of Iſrael, looked vpon the triumphall reuels of Amalek; and what a change, do we thinke, appeared in them, when they ſaw their happy and ualiant Reſcuers, flying in vpon their inſolent Victors, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the death of the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites, the ranſome of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity; They mourned euen now at the dances of Amalek; now in the ſhriekes and death of Amalek, they ſhout and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19686:62"/>
The mercy of our God forgets not to enterchange our ſorrowes with ioy, and the ioy oſ the wicked with ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>The Amalekites haue paid a deare lone for the goods of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, which they now reſtore with their owne liues; and now their ſpoyle hath made <hi>Dauid</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher then he expected; that boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which they had ſwept from all other parts accrewed to him.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Iſralites that could not goe on to fight for their ſhare, are comne to meete their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren with gratulation. How partiall are wee wont to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our owne cauſes? Euen very Iſraelites will bee ready to fall out for matter of profit: where

ſelfe-loue hath bred a quarrell, euery man is ſubiect to flatter his owne caſe. It ſeemed plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and but iuſt to the actors in this reſcue, that thoſe which had taken no part in the paine, and hazard of the journey, ſhould receiue no part of the commodity. It was fauour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for them to recouer their wiues &amp; children, though they ſhared not in the goods. Wiſe and holy <hi>Dauid</hi> (whoſe praiſe was no leſſe, to ouercome his owne in time of peace, then his enimies in warre) calls his contending followers from law to equity, and ſo orders the matter, that ſince the plaintifes were detained not by will, but

They had their part in <hi>Sauls</hi> ſinne: they were actors in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> perſecution: Iuſtly therfore doe they ſuffer with him, whom they had ſeconded in offence.

their owne ſwords had beene more familiar executioners, they yelded vnto them, what they grudged to their purſuers.

Hee might haue beene a patient in anothers violence, and faultleſſe; now whiles hee will needs act the Philiſtims part vpon himſelfe, hee liued and dyed a murderer; The caſe is deadly, when the priſoner breakes the Iayle, and will not ſtay for his deliuery: &amp; though wee may not paſſe ſentence v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſuch a Soule, yet vpon the fact we may: the Soule may poſſibly repent in the parting, the act is haynous, and ſuch as

                  <p>It was the next day, ere the Philiſtims knew how much they were victors; then finding the dead corpes of <hi>Saul</hi> and his Sonnes, they begin their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs: The head of King <hi>Saul</hi> is cut off in lieu of <hi>Goliahs,</hi> and now all their Idoll temples ring of their ſucceſſe; Fooliſh Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims, If they had not beene more beholden to <hi>Sauls</hi> ſinnes, then their Gods, they had neuer carryed away the honor of thoſe trophees: In ſteed of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the iuſtice of the true God, who puniſhed <hi>Saul</hi> with deſerued death, they magnifie the power of the falſe: Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition

he offred that violence to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: The hand of this Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite therfore was not guilty, his tongue was: Had not this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger meaſur'd <hi>Dauids</hi> foot, by his owne laſt, hee had forborne this peece of the newes; and not hoped to aduantage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by this falſhood: Now he thinks; The tydings of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cannot but pleaſe: None but <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> ſtood in <hi>Dauids</hi> way: Hee cannot chuſe, but like to heare of their remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall: Eſpecially, ſince <hi>Saul</hi> did ſo tyrannouſly perſecute his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.

                  <p>How much was this Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kite mocked of his hopes: whiles he imagined, that <hi>Dauid</hi> would now triumph, and feaſt in the aſſured expectation of the

And if neither his own wound, nor mine, had diſpatched him, the Philiſtims were at his heeles, ready to doe this ſame act with inſultation, which I did in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: and if my hand had not preuented them, wherehad been the Crowne of Iſrael, which I now haue here preſented to thee: I could haue deliuered that to King <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and haue beene rewarded with honour: let mee not dye for an act well meant to thee, how euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued by thee: But no pretence can make his owne tale not deadly. <hi>(Thy bloud bee vpon thine owne head, for thine owne mouth hath teſtified againſt thee ſaying, I haue ſlaine the Lords Anoynted.)</hi> It is a

So ſhall we, if we indure to the end, finde a Crowne of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which the Lord the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iudge, ſhall giue vs at that day: But though <hi>Dauid</hi> well knew that his head was long before anoynted, and had heard <hi>Saul</hi> himſelfe confidently auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his ſucceſſion: yet he will not ſtirre from the heapes of Ziglag, till hee haue conſulted with the Lord: It did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, that he had Gods war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the kingdome, but hee muſt haue his inſtructions for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19686:75"/>
the taking poſſeſſion of it: How ſafe and happie is the man that is reſolued to do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God? Neither will genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of direction be ſufficient; euen particular circumſtances muſt looke for a word: ſtill is God a piller of fire, and cloude to the eye of euery Iſraelite: neither may there be any moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſtay but from him; That action cannot but ſucceed, which proceeds vpon ſo ſure a warrant:</p>
                  <p>God ſends him to Hebron a city of Iudah: Neither will <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> goe vp thither alone, but he takes with him all his men with their whole houſholds: they ſhall take ſuch part as himſelfe:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19686:76"/>
As they had ſhared with him in his miſery, ſo they ſhall now in his proſperity: Neither doth he take aduantage of their late mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinye (which was yet freſh and greene) to caſhier thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull, and vngracious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, but pardoning their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret rebellions, he makes them partakers of his good ſucceſſe. Thus doth our heauenly leader (whom <hi>Dauid</hi> prefigured) take vs to raigne with him who haue ſuffered with him: paſſing by our manyfold infirmities, as if they had not beene, he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs from the land of our baniſhment, and the aſhes of our forlorne Ziklag, to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron of our peace, and glory:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19686:76"/>
The expectation of this day muſt (as it did with <hi>Dauids</hi> ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) digeſt all our ſorrows.</p>
                  <p>Neuer any calling of God was ſo conſpicuous, as not to finde ſome oppoſites: What Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite did not know <hi>Dauid,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to the ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the kingdome?

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19686:77"/>
The Sonnes of <hi>Zeruiah</hi> ſtand faſt to <hi>Dauid:</hi> It is much, how a man placeth his firſt intereſt: If <hi>Abner</hi> had beene in <hi>Ioabs</hi> roome, when <hi>Sauls</hi> diſpleaſure droue <hi>Dauid</hi> from the Court, or <hi>Ioab</hi> in <hi>Abners,</hi> theſe actions, theſe e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uents had beene changed with the perſons: It was the only happines of <hi>Ioab</hi> that he fell on the better ſide:</p>

                  <p>Oh, the miſery of ciuill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention: Iſrael and Iudah were brethren: One carryed the name of the Father, the other of the Sonne: Iudah was but a branch of Iſrael, Iſrael was the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:19686:79"/>
root of Iudah: yet Iudah and Iſrael muſt fight, and kill each other; only vpon the quarrell of an ill leaders ambition. The ſpeed of <hi>Aſahel</hi> was not greater then his courage: It was a minde fit for one of <hi>Dauids</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, to ſtrike at the head, to match himſelfe with the beſt: He was both ſwift and ſtrong: but the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong: If he had gone neuer ſo ſlowly, he might haue ouertaken death: now he runnes to fetch it. So little luſt had <hi>Abner</hi> to ſhed the blood of a Son of <hi>Zeruiah,</hi> that he twice aduiſes him to retreat from purſuing his owne perill: <hi>Aſahels</hi> cauſe was ſo much better

It is as dangerous as vniuſt for Princes, to giue both their eares and their heart to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded rumors of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent followers: This wrong hath ſtript <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> of the Kingdome; <hi>Abner</hi> in the meane time cannot be excuſed from a trecherous inconſtancy; If <hi>Sauls</hi> ſon had no true title to the Crowne, why did he maintaine it; If hee had, why did hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the cauſe and perſon? Had <hi>Abner</hi> out of remorſe, for furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a falſe claime taken off his hand, I know not wherein hee could be blamed, except for not doing it ſooner; But now to withdraw his profeſſed allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, vpon a priuate reuenge,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19686:83"/>
was to take a lewd leaue of an ill action: If <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> were his lawfull Prince, no iniury could warrant a reuolt; Euen betwixt priuate perſons, a returne of wrongs is both vncharitable, and vniuſt, how euer this goe currant for the common juſtice of the world, how much more ſhould we learn from a ſupreme hand, to take hard meaſures with thankes? It had been <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers</hi> duty, to haue giuen his King a peaceable and humble ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and not to fly out in a ſnuffe. If the ſpirit of the ruler riſe vp againſt thee, leaue not thy place, for yeelding, pacifieth great offences; now, his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient falling, although to the

right ſide, makes him no better then trayterouſly honeſt.</p>
                  <p>So ſoone as <hi>Abner</hi> hath enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a reſolution of his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; hee perſwades the Elders of Iſrael to accompany him in the change: &amp; whence doth he fetch his main motiue, but from the Oracle of God? <hi>(The Lord hath ſpoken of Dauid, ſaying, By the hand of my ſeruant Dauid, will I ſaue my people Iſrael, out of the hand of the Philiſtims, and out of the hand of all their enemies;) Abner</hi> knew this full well before, yet then was well content to ſmother a knowne truth for his owne turne, and now the publication of it may ſerue for his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he wins the heart of Iſrael,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19686:84"/>
by ſhewing Gods Charter for him, whom he had ſo long op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: Hypocrites make vſe of God for their owne purpoſes; and care onely to make diuine authority a colour for their owne deſignes; No man euer heard <hi>Abner</hi> godly till now; neither had hee beene ſo at this time, if hee had not intended a reuengefull departure from <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth:</hi> Nothing is more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then to make religion a ſtalking horſe to policy.</p>
                  <p>Who can but glorifie God in his Iuſtice, when he ſees the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of this trecherous diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation: <hi>Dauid</hi> may vpon conſiderations of ſtate, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his new gueſt with a feaſt;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19686:85"/>
and well might he ſeeme to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a welcom, that vndertakes to bring all Iſrael to the league and homage of <hi>Dauid:</hi> but God neuer meant to vſe ſo vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy meanes, for ſo good a work. <hi>Ioab</hi> returnes from purſuing a troop, and finding <hi>Abner</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed in peace and expectation of a beneficiall returne followes him, and whether out of enuy, at a new riuall of honour, or out of the reuenge of <hi>Aſahel,</hi> he repayes him both diſſimulation and death; God doth moſt iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Ioab,</hi> that which <hi>Ioab</hi> did for himſelfe moſt vniuſtly, I know not (ſetting the quarrell aſide) whether we can worthily blame <hi>Abner</hi> for the death of

                     <hi>Aſahel,</hi> who would needes after faire warnings, run himſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Abners</hi> ſpeare: yet this fact ſhall procure his payment for worſe. Now is <hi>Iſhboſheths</hi> wrong reuenged by an enemy; wee may not alwayes meaſure the Iuſtice of Gods procedings, by preſent occaſions; He needs not make vs acquainted, or aske vs leaue when hee will call for the arrerages of forgotten ſins.</p>

                  <p>It is long, ſince Iſrael ſaw ſo faire a day as this, wherein they went in this holy triumph to fetch the Ark of God; Now their warlike trumpets are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Harpes and Timbrils; and their hands in ſteed of weilding the Sword and Speare, ſtrike vpon thoſe muſicall
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19686:90"/>
ſtrings whereby they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ioy of their hearts; heere was no noyſe but of mirth, no motion but pleaſant: oh happy Iſrael that had a God to reioyce in, that had this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of reioycing in their God, and an hart that embraced this occaſion. There is nothing but this wherein wee may not ioy immoderately, vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; this ſpirituall ioy can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be either out of time, or out of meaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him that reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, reioyce in the Lord. But now when the Iſraelites were in the midſt of this Angel-like io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, their hearts lifted vp, their hands playing, their feete mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, their tongues ſinging and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19686:91"/>
ſhouting, God ſees good to ſtrike them into a ſudden dumpe by the death of <hi>Vzzah:</hi> They are ſcarce ſet into the tune when God mars their Muſicke, by a fearefull iudgement; and changes their mirth into aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and confuſion; There could not bee more excellent worke then this they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; there could not be more cheerefull hearts in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of it, yet will the moſt holy God rather daſh all this ſolemne ſeruice, then indure an act of preſumption or infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Abinadab</hi> had bene the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hoſt of Gods Ark, for the ſpace of twenty yeares: euen in the midſt of the terrors of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:19686:91"/>
who were iuſtly affrighted with the vengance inflicted v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Beth-ſhemeſh, did he giue harbour vnto it; Yet euen the Son of <hi>Abinadab</hi> is ſtriken dead, in the firſt departing of that bleſſed gueſt: The Sanctity of the Parent cannot beare out the ſinne of his Sonne: The holy one of Iſrael will bee ſanctified in all that come neare him: He will be ſerued like himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>What then was the ſinne of <hi>Vzzah?</hi> What was the capitall crime, for which he ſo feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſhed? That the Arke of God was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the Cart, it was not his deuice only, but the common act of many, That it was not caryed on the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19686:92"/>
ſhoulders of Leuites, was no leſſe the fault of <hi>Ahio,</hi> and the reſt of their brethren; only <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi> is ſtriken: The reſt ſinned in negligence, he in preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Ark God ſhakes with the agitation of that cariage; he puts forth his hand to hold it ſteddy; Humane iudgement would haue found heerein nothing haynous: God ſees not with the eyes of men; None but the Prieſts ſhould haue dared to touch the Ark; It was enough for the Leuites to touch the bars that carryed it; An vnwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hand cannot ſo lightly touch the Ark, but hee ſtrikes the God that dwels in it: No maruell if God ſtrike that man
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19686:92"/>
with death, that ſtrikes him with preſumption; There was wel-neare the ſame quarell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the thouſands of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemeſh, and againſt <hi>Vzzah;</hi> They dyed for looking into the Ark, he for touching it; leaſt Iſrael ſhould grow into a contemptuous familiarity with this Teſtimony of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he will hold them in awe with iudgements: The reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hand of the Almighty, that vpon the returne of the Ark ſtayed at the houſe of <hi>Ahinadab,</hi> vpon the remoue of the Ark begins there againe: Where are thoſe that thinke God will take vp with a careleſſe and ſlubbred ſeruice? He whoſe infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19686:93"/>
vſes to paſſe by our ſinnes of infirmity, puniſheth yet ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our bold faults: If wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe any thing in the degrees that he requireth, yet wee muſt learne to doe all things in the forme that he requireth; Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Vzzah</hi> meant no otherwiſe then well in putting forth his hand to ſtay the Ark; He knew the ſacred vtenſills that were in it, the pot of Manna, the Tables of the Law, the rod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which might bee wronged by that ouer-rough motion: to theſe hee offers his ayd, and is ſtriken dead; The beſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot excuſe; much leſſe warrant vs in vnlawfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; where wee doe ought in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:19686:93"/>
faith, it pleaſeth our good God to wink at, and pitty our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; but if we dare to preſent God with the well-meant ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our owne making, wee runne into the indignation of God; There is nothing more dangerous, then to be our owne caruers in matter of deuotion.</p>
                  <p>I maruell not if the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>Dauid</hi> were ſuddenly changed, to ſee the pale face of death in one of the cheefe actors in this holy proceſſion: Hee that had found God ſo fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him in actions of leſſe worth, is troubled to ſee this ſucceſſe of a buſineſſe ſo hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directed vnto his God; and now he begins to look thorow
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:19686:94"/>
                     <hi>Vzzah</hi> at himſelfe, and to ſay, <hi>(How ſhall the Arke of the Lord come to mee?)</hi> Then onely ſhall we make a right vſe of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God vpon others, when we ſhall feare them in our ſelues, and finding our ſins at leaſt equall, ſhall tremble at the expectation of the ſame deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued puniſhments. God intends not onely reuenge in his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but reformation; As good Princes regard not ſo much the ſmart of the euill paſt, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of the future; which is neuer attained, but when wee make applications of Gods hand; and draw common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes out of Gods particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:19686:94"/>
I doe not heare <hi>Dauid</hi> ſay; Surely, this man is guilty of ſome ſecret ſin, that the world knowes not; God hath met with him; there is no danger to vs; why ſhould I bee diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſee God iuſt? Wee may goe on ſafely and proſper; but here his foot ſtaies, and his hand fals from his inſtrument, and his tongue is ready to tax his owne vnworthineſſe, <hi>(How ſhall the Arke of the Lord come vnto mee?)</hi> That heart is carnall and proud, that thinkes any man worſe then himſelfe; <hi>Dauids</hi> feare ſtayes his progreſſe; Perhaps, he might haue proceeded with good ſucceſſe, but hee dares not venture, where hee ſees ſuch a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19686:95"/>
deadly checke: It is better to bee too fearefull, then too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in thoſe affaires, which do immediately concerne God; As it is not good to refrain from holy buſineſſes, ſo it is worſe to doe them ill; Awfulneſſe is a ſafe interpreter of Gods ſecret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and a wiſe guide of ours.</p>
                  <p>This euent hath holpen <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> to a gueſt he lookt not for, God ſhall now ſoiourne in the houſe of him, in whoſe heart he dwelt before by a ſtrong faith; elſe the man durſt not haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, to receiue that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Arke, which <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe feared to harbour; Oh the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of an honeſt and faithfull heart; <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19686:95"/>
what ſlaughter the Arke had made among the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims, and after that amongſt the Beth ſhemites, and now hee ſaw <hi>Vzzah</hi> lye dead before him, yet doth hee not make any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of entertaining it, neither doth he ſay, My neigbour <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nadab</hi> was a carefull and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hoſt to the Ark, and is now payed with the bloud of his ſon; how ſhall I hope to ſpeede better; but he opens his doores with a bold cheerefulneſſe, and notwithſtanding all thoſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, bids God welcome: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make God not amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his owne; Euen his very Iuſtice is louely: Holy men know how to reioyce in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19686:96"/>
Lord with trembling, and can feare without diſcouragement.</p>
                  <p>The God of Heauen will not receiue any thing from men on free coſt; hee will pay liberally for his lodging, a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull bleſſing vpon <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> and all his houſhold. It was an honour to that zealous Gittite, that the Arke would come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his roofe; yet God rewards that honour with benediction: Neuer man was a loſer by true godlineſſe; The houſe of <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> cannot this while want obſeruation; the eyes of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> and all Iſrael are neuer off from it, to ſee how it fared with this entertainment. And now, when they finde nothing, but a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19686:96"/>
gracious acceptation and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bleſſing, the good King of Iſrael takes new heart, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens to fetch the Arke into his royall City. The view of Gods fauours vpon the godly, is no ſmall encouragement to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and obedience; Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> was not free from ſome weakneſſes; If the Lord ſhould haue taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of judgement againſt him, what Iſraelites had not been diſhartned from attending the Arke? Now <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; Iſrael was not more affrighted with the vengeance vpon <hi>Vzzah,</hi> then encouraged by the bleſſing of <hi>Obed-Edom;</hi> The wiſe God doth ſo order his iuſt and mercifull
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19686:97"/>
proceedings, that the aweful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men may be tempered with loue. Now the ſweet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Iſrael reuiues his holy Muſicke; and addes both more ſpirit and more pompe to ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout a buſineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heare of trumpets, nor dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, nor ſhouting, nor ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor the linnen Ephod; The ſenſe of Gods paſſed diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, doubles our care to pleaſe him, and our ioy in his recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red approbation; wee neuer make ſo much of our health, as after ſickneſſe, nor neuer are ſo officious to our frend, as after an vnkindneſſe. In the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Ark, <hi>Dauids</hi> feare was at leaſt an equall match to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19686:97"/>
his ioy; therefore after the firſt ſixe paces hee offred a ſacrifice, both to pacifie God, and thank him: but now when they ſaw no ſigne of diſlike, they did more freely let themſelues looſe to a feareleſſe ioy; and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtroue to expreſſe the holy affection of the Soule; there was no limme, no part that did not profeſſe their mirth by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no noyſe of voyce, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument wanted to aſſiſt their ſpirituall iollity; <hi>Dauid</hi> led the way, dauncing with all his might in his linnen Ephod; <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi> was ſtill in his eye; he durſt not vſurpe vpon a garment of Prieſts; but hee will borrow their colour to grace the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19686:98"/>
though he dare not the faſhion; White was euer the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ioy, and linnen was light for vſe; therfore he couers his Princely robes with white linnin, and meanes to honor himſelfe by his conformity to Gods miniſters. Thoſe that thinke there is diſgrace in the Ephod, are farre from the Spirit of the man after Gods owne hart; Neither can there bee a greater argument of a foule Soule, then a diſlike of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious calling of God: Barren <hi>Mical</hi> hath too many Sons that ſcorne the holy habit and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes: ſhee lookes through her window, and ſeeing the attyre and geſtures of her deuout hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19686:98"/>
deſpiſeth him in her hart, neither can ſhee conceale her contempt, but like <hi>Sauls</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſt it proudly in his face <hi>(Oh how glorious was the King of Iſrael this day; which was vncouered to day in the eyes of the Maidens of his ſeruants, as a foole vncouereth himſelfe.)</hi> Worldly harts can ſee nothing in actions of zeale, but folly and madneſſe: Piety hath no reliſh to their palate but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauids</hi> hart did neuer ſwell ſo much at any reproch, as this of his wife; his loue was for the time loſt in his anger; and as a man impatient of no affront ſo much as in the way of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, hee returnes a bitter
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19686:99"/>
checke to his <hi>Micall; (It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, which choſe me rather then thy Father, &amp; all his houſe, &amp;c.)</hi> Had not <hi>Mical</hi> twitted her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with the ſhame of his zeale, ſhe had not heard of the ſhamefull reiection of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; now ſince ſhee will be forrgetting, whoſe wife ſhe was, ſhe ſhall be put in minde whoſe daughter ſhe was. Contumelyes that are caſt vpon vs in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, may ſafely bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed: If we be meal-mouthed in the ſcornes of religion, wee are not patient, but zeale-leſſe: Heere we may not forbeare her, that lies in our boſome. If <hi>Dauid</hi> had not loued <hi>Mical</hi> dearely, he had neuer ſtood vpon thoſe

points with <hi>Abner;</hi> Hee knew that if <hi>Abner</hi> came to him, the Kingdome of Iſrael would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him, and yet he ſends him the charge of not ſeeing his face, except he brought <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Sauls</hi> daughter with him; as if he would not regard the Crowne of Iſrael, whiles hee wanted that wife of his; Yet heere hee takes her vp roundly, as if ſhe had bene an enimy, not a partener of his bed; All rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are a loofe off, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that betwixt God, and the Soule; He that loues Father, or Mother, or wife, or childe, better then me (ſaith our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) is not worthy of me. Euen the higheſt delights of our harts
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19686:100"/>
muſt be trampled vpon, when they will ſtand out in riuality with God. Oh happy reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the royall Prophet, and propheticall King of Iſrael, (I will bee yet more vile then thus, and will bee low in mine owne ſight) he knew this very abaſement heroycall; and that the only way to true glory, is not to be aſhamed of our low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt humiliation vnto God: Well might he promiſe himſelfe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor from thoſe, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſhee had threatned; The hearts of men are not their owne, hee that made them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-rules them, and inclines them to an honorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of thoſe that honor their

yet wee finde, that the beſt, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſed is moſt dangerous: Who ſhould be the patterne of Kings, but the King of God?

that they ſhall by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment rather tarry abroad, till time haue wrought their conformity, then vary from the receiued faſhions of their owne people.

                  <p>How obſtinate are wicked men in their peruerſe reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Theſe fooliſh Ammonites had rather hyre Syrians to maintaine a warre againſt Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in ſo foule a quarrell, beſides the hazard of their owne liues,

then confeſſe the error of their iealous miſ-conſtruction.</p>
                  <p>It is one of the madde prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of wickedneſſe, that it is a weakeneſſe to relent, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Dye then yeild; Euen ill cauſes once vndertaken, muſt bee vpheld although with bloud; whereas the gracious hart finding his owne mis-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, doth not only remit of an vngrounded diſpleaſure, but ſtudies to bee reuenged of it ſelfe; and to giue ſatisfaction to the offended.</p>
                  <p>The mercenary Syrians are drawne to venture their liues for a fee; twenty thouſand of them are hyred into the field againſt Iſrael; Fond Pagans that

                  <p>Set aſide ſome particular actions, <hi>Ioab</hi> was a worthy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, both for wiſdome and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Who could either exhort

or reſolue better then he, <hi>(Be of good courage, and let vs play the men, for our people, and for the cities of our God; and the Lord doe that which ſeemeth him good?)</hi> It is not either priuate glory or profit that whets his fortitude, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the cauſe of God, and his people; That Souldier can neuer anſwer it to God, that ſtrikes not more as a Iuſticer, then as an enemy; Neither doth hee content himſelfe with his owne courage, but he animates others. The tongue of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander fights more then his hand; it is enough for priuate men to exerciſe what life and limmes they haue, a good Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt out of his owne abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19686:121"/>
put life and ſpirits into all others; If a Lyon lead ſheep into the field, there is hope of victory: Laſtly, when he hath done his beſt, he reſolues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon God for the iſſue: not truſting to his ſword, or his bowe, but to the prouidence of the Almightie for ſucceſſe; as a man religiouſly awfull, and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confident, whiles there ſhould bee no want in their owne indeuours: he knew well that the race was not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, therefore hee lookes vp aboue the hills whence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his ſaluation; All valour is cowardiſe to that, which is built vpon religion.</p>

The ſuites of Kings are impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue; Ambition did now proue a bawd to luſt. <hi>Bathſheba</hi> yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to offend God, to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her husband, to clogge and wound her owne Soule, to abuſe her body: Diſhoneſty growes bold, when it is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced with greatneſſe.

then it magnifies the religious zeale of <hi>Vriah,</hi> that he abandons comfort, till he ſee the Arke and Iſrael victorious.</p>
                  <p>Common dangers, or cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities muſt (like the rapt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) carry our hearts contrary to to the wayes of our priuate oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
                  <p>Hee that cannot bee mooued with words, ſhall be tryed with wine, <hi>Vriah</hi> had equally prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted againſt feaſting at home, and ſociety with his wife; To the one, the authority of a King forces him abroad, in hope that the exceſſe thereof ſhall force him to the other: It is like, that holy Captaine intended onely to yeeld ſo much obedience, as

But wine is a mocker, when it goes plauſibly in, no man can imagine how it will rage and tyrannize; he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues that Traytor within his gates, ſhall too late complaine of a ſurprizall. Like vnto that ill ſpirit, it inſinuates ſweetly, but in the end, it bites like a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, &amp; hurts like a Cockatrice. Euen good <hi>Vrias</hi> is made drunk; the holyeſt ſoule may bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; It is hard gaine-ſaying, where a King begins an health to a ſubiect; Where, oh where, will this wickedneſſe end? <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> will now procure the ſin of another, to hide his owne; <hi>Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> drunkenneſſe is more <hi>Dauids</hi>

                  <p>Had not <hi>Dauid</hi> knowne, that wine was an inducement to luſt, he had ſpared thoſe ſuperfluous cups. Experience had taught him, that the eye debauched with wine, will looke vpon ſtrange women: The Drunkard may bee any thing ſaue good. Yet in this the ayme failed; Grace is ſtronger then wine; Whiles that with-holds, in vaine ſhall the fury of the grape at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to carry <hi>Vriah</hi> to his own bed.

thee, ô thou good Spirit, that hadſt wont to guide thy choſen ſeruant in his former wayes? Is not this the man, whom wee lately ſaw ſo heart-ſmitten, for but cutting off the lap of the garment of a wicked Maſter, that is now thus lauiſh of the bloud, of a gracious and well-deſeruing Seruant? Could it be likely, that ſo worthy a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine could fall alone? Could <hi>Dauid</hi> haue expiated this ſinne with his owne bloud, it had beene but well ſpent, but to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his ſinne with the innocent bloud of others, was a crime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue aſtoniſhment.

                     <hi>Dauid</hi> was a Prophet of God, yet he hath not only ſtept into theſe foule ſinnes, but ſoiournes with them; If any profeſſion or ſtate of life could haue priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged from ſinne; the Angels had not ſinned in heauen, nor man in Paradiſe: <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet is ſent to the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> for reproofe, for conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Had it beene any other mans caſe, none could haue

Euen the Phiſition himſelfe when he is ſicke, ſends for the counſell of thoſe whom his health did mutually ayde with aduiſe. Let no man think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe too good to learne; Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers themſelues may be taught that in their owne particular, which in a generality they haue often taught others; It is not only ignorance that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, but miſ-affection.</p>
                  <p>Who can preſcribe a iuſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the beſt mans repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? About ten moneths are paſſed ſince <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne; in all

                  <p>It might haue pleaſed God as eaſily to haue ſent <hi>Nathan</hi> to check <hi>Dauid</hi> in his firſt purpoſe
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:19686:138"/>
of ſinning; So had his eyes beene reſtrayned, <hi>Bathſheba</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, <hi>Vriah</hi> aliue with honor; now the wiſdome of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty knew how to winne more glory by the permiſſion of ſo foule an euill, then by the preuention; yea, he knew how by the permiſſion of one ſinne, to preuent millions; how many thouſand had ſinned in a vaine preſumption on their owne ſtrength, if <hi>Dauid</hi> had not thus offended; how many thouſand had deſpayred in the conſcience of their owne weakeneſſes, if theſe horrible ſinnes had not receiued forgiueneſſe.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19686:139"/>
It matters not how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the pill is, but how well wrapped; ſo cunningly hath <hi>Nathan</hi> conueyed this doſe, that it begins to worke ere it bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted; there is no one thing wherin is more vſe of wiſdome, then the due contriuing of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, which in a diſcreet deliuery helps the diſeaſe, in an vnwiſe, deſtroyes nature.</p>

in his narration, in his inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue, ere <hi>Dauid</hi> would haue bene touched with his owne guiltineſſe; but now that the Prophet brings the word home to his boſome, he cannot but be affected. Wee may take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to heare men ſpeake in the clouds, we neuer take profit till we finde a propriety in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, or reproofe; There was not more cunning in the parable, then courage in the application <hi>(Thou art the man)</hi> If <hi>Dauid</hi> be a King, hee may not look, not to heare of his faults; Gods meſſages may be no other then vnpartial. It is a trecherous flattery in diuine errands to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard greatneſſe: If Prophets
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:19686:140"/>
muſt be mannerly in the forme, yet in the matter of reproofe, reſolute: The words are not their owne, They are but the Heralds of the King of heauen, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How thunder-ſtriken do we thinke <hi>Dauid</hi> did now ſtand? how did the change of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour bewray the confuſion in his Soule; whiles his conſcience ſaid the ſame within, which the Prophet ſounded in his eare? And now leaſt ought ſhould be wanting to his humiliation, all Gods former fauours ſhall bee layd before his eyes, by way of exprobration: He is worthy to be vpbraided with mercies, that hath abuſed mercyes vnto wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19686:141"/>
whiles we doe well, God giues and ſayes nothing, when we doe ill, hee layes his benefits in our diſh, and caſts them in our teeth, that our ſhame may bee ſo much the more; by how much our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations haue bene greater. The bleſſings of God in our vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy caryage proue but the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauations of ſinne, and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to iudgement.</p>
                  <p>I ſee all Gods children falling into ſinne, ſome of them lying in ſinne; none of them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning their ſinne; <hi>Dauid</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue the hart, or the face to ſtand out againſt the meſſage of God, but now as a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and condemned in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:19686:141"/>
himſelfe, hee cryes out in the bitterneſſe of a wounded Soule, <hi>(I haue ſinned againſt the Lord)</hi> It was a ſhort word, but paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and ſuch as came from the bottome of a contrite hart; The greateſt griefes are not moſt verball: <hi>Saul</hi> confeſſed his ſinne more largely, leſſe effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; God cares not for phraſes, but for affections. The firſt peece of our amends to God for ſinning, is the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne; He can do little that in a iuſt offence cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfe: If we cannot be ſo good as we would, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we ſhould do God ſo much right, as to ſay, how euill we are.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19686:142"/>
It is ſtrange to ſee how eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſin gets into the hart, how hardly it gets out of the mouth; Is it becauſe ſinne, like vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, where it hath got poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is deſirous to hold it; and knowes that it is fully eiected by a free confeſſion? or, becauſe in a guiltineſſe of deformity, it hides it ſelfe in the breſt where it is once intertained, and hates the light? or becauſe the tongue is ſo fee'd with ſelfe-loue, that it is loath to bee drawne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any verdict againſt the hart, or hands? or, is it out of an idle miſpriſion of ſhame, which whiles it ſhould bee placed in offending, is miſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in diſcloſing of our offence?</p>

                     <hi>Dauid</hi> had ſworne in a zeale of Iuſtice, that the rich Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, for but taking his poore neighbours lambe, ſhould dye the death; God, by <hi>Nathan,</hi> is more fauourable to <hi>Dauid,</hi> then to take him at his word; <hi>Thou ſhalt not dye:</hi> O the maruellous power of repentance; Beſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, <hi>Dauid</hi> had ſhed the bloud of innocent <hi>Vriah;</hi> The

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe ſhall not dye for this fact; but his miſ-begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten childe ſhall dye for him; He that ſayd, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin,</hi> yet ſayd alſo, <hi>The ſword ſhall</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame mouth, with one breath, pronounces the ſentence both of abſolution, and death, Abſolution to the perſon, death to the iſſue. Pardon may well ſtand with temporall afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Where God hath forgiuen, though he doe not puniſh, yet he may chaſtize, and that vnto bloud; neither doth he alwaies forbeare correction, where hee remits reuenge. So long as he ſmites vs not as an angry Iudge, wee may indure to ſmart from him, as a louing father.</p>
                  <p>Yet euen this rod did <hi>Dauid</hi> deprecate with teares: how faine would he ſhake off ſo eaſie a lode? The childe is ſtricken;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19686:144"/>
the father faſts and prayes, and weepes, and lyes all night vpon the earth, and abhors the noyſe of comfort; That childe, which was the fruit and monument of his odious adultery, whom hee could neuer haue looked vpon, without a recognition of his ſin; in whoſe face he could not but haue ſtill read the records of his own ſhame, is thus mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for, thus ſued for; It is eaſie to obſerue that good man ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionately affected to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Who would not haue thought, that <hi>Dauid</hi> might haue held himſelfe well appayd, that his ſoule eſcaped an eternall death, his body a violent: though God ſhould puniſh his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19686:145"/>
ſin, in that childe, in whom hee ſinned: Yet euen againſt this croſſe, he bends his prayers, as if nothing had been forgiuen him: There is no childe that would be ſcourged, if he might eſcape for crying; No affliction is for the time other then greeuous; neither is therfore yeelded vnto, without ſome kinde of relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Far yet was it from the heart of <hi>Dauid,</hi> to make any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the will of God; he ſued, he ſtrugled not; There is no impatience in entreaties; He wel knew, that the threats of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral euils, ran commonly with a ſecret condition; and therfore might perhaps bee auoyded by humble importunity: If any

                  <p>God Could not chuſe, but like well the boldneſſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> faith, who after the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſo heauy a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is ſo far from doubting of the forgiueneſſe of his ſin, that hee dares become a Sutor vnto God for his ſicke childe.

                  <p>But, it is not in the power of the ſtrongeſt faith, to preſerue vs from all afflictions; After all <hi>Dauids</hi> prayers and teares, the childe muſt dye. The carefull ſeruants dare but whiſper this ſad newes: They, who had found their Maſter ſo auerſe

                  <p>Suſpition is quick-witted; Euery occaſion makes vs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt that euent, which wee feare; This ſecrecy proclaymes, that which they were ſo loth to vtter; <hi>Dauid</hi> perceiues his childe dead, and now he riſes vp from the earth whereon hee lay, and waſhes himſelfe, and changeth his apparrell, and goes firſt into Gods houſe to worſhip, and then into his owne to eat; now he refuſes no comfort, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would take none; The iſſue of things doth more fully ſhew the will of God, then the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:19686:146"/>
God neuer did any thing, but what hee would; hee hath ſometimes foretold that for tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, which his ſecret will inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not; hee would foretell it, hee would not effect it, becauſe hee would therfore foretell it, that he might not effect it; His predictions of outward euils are not alwayes abſolute, his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are; <hi>Dauid</hi> well ſees by the euent, what the decree of God was, concerning his childe; which now he could not ſtriue againſt, without a vaine impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; Till wee know the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of the Almighty, it is free for vs to ſtriue in our prayers; to ſtriue with him, not againſt him; when once

great Princes ſhould want ſome paraſiticall followers, that are ready to feede their ill humours. <hi>Why art thou, the Kings ſon ſo leane from day to day?</hi> As if it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the heyre of a King, to ſuffer either law, or conſcience, to ſtand in the way of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: Whereas wiſe Princes know well, that their places giue them no priuiledge of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but call them in rather to ſo much more ſtrictneſſe, as their example may be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ionadab</hi> was the cozen ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Amnon;</hi> Ill aduiſe is ſo much more dangerous, as the intereſt of the giuer is more; Had he been a true frend, he had

bent all the forces of his diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, againſt the wicked moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that ſinfull luſt; and had ſhewed the Prince of Iſrael how much thoſe lewd deſires prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God, and blemiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and had lent his hand to ſtrangle them in their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. There cannot bee a more worthy improuement of frendſhip, then in a feruent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the ſinnes of them; whom wee profeſſe to loue: No enemy can be ſo mortall to great Princes, as thoſe officious clients, whoſe flattery ſoothes them vp in wickedneſſe; Theſe are traytors to the Soule, and by a pleaſing violence kill the beſt part eternally.</p>

How redy at hand is an euill ſuggeſtion? Good counſell is like vnto well water, that muſt be drawne vp with a Pumpe, or bucket; Ill counſell is like to Conduit-water, which if the cocke be but turned, runs out alone; <hi>Ionadab</hi> hath ſoone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected how <hi>Amnon</hi> ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his lawleſſe purpoſe. The way muſt bee to fayne himſelfe ſicke in body, whoſe minde was ſicke of luſt; and vnder this pretence to procure the preſence of her, who had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and only might cure him.</p>
                  <p>The daily-increaſing lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, and leaneneſſe, and pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of loue-ſicke <hi>Amnon</hi> might well giue colour to a kercheife,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19686:151"/>
and a pallet. Now it is ſoone told <hi>Dauid</hi> that his eldeſt Sonne is caſt vpon his ſickebed; there needs no ſuit for his viſitation; The carefull father haſtens to his bed-ſide, not without doubts and feares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that was lately ſo afflicted with the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ of a childe that ſcarce liued to ſee the light, how ſenſible muſt we needs thinke he would be, of the indiſpoſition of his firſt borne Sonne, in the prime of his age and hopes; It is not giuen to any Prophet to foreſee all things; Happy had it beene for <hi>Dauid,</hi> if <hi>Amnon</hi> had beene truly ſicke, and ſick vnto death; yet who could haue perſwaded this paſſionate father to haue
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:19686:152"/>
beene content with this ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of loſſes, this early loſſe of his ſucceſſor: How glad is hee to heare, that his daughter <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</hi> skill might be likely to fit the dyet of ſo deare a patient. Conceit is wont to rule much both in ſickneſſe, and the cure. <hi>Tamar</hi> is ſent by her father to the houſe of <hi>Amnon;</hi> Her hand only muſt dreſſe that diſh, which may pleaſe the nice Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of her ſicke brother. Euen the children of Kings, in thoſe homelyer times, did not ſcorne to put their fingers, to ſome workes of huſwifrie: <hi>(She tooke floure and did knead it, and did make cakes in his ſight, and did bake the cakes, and tooke a panne, and poured</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:19686:152"/>
                     <hi>them out before him.)</hi> Had ſhe not beene ſometimes vſed to ſuch domeſtique imployments, ſhee had bene now to ſeeke; neither had this bene required of her, but vpon the knowledge of her skill: She doth not plead, the impayring of her beauty by the ſcorching of the fire; nor thinkes her hand too dainty for ſuch meane ſeruices; but fettles to the worke, as one that had rather regard the neceſſities of her brother, then her owne ſtate: Only pride and idleneſſe, haue baniſht honeſt and thrifty diligence, out of the houſes of the great.</p>
                  <p>This was not yet the diſh that <hi>Amnon</hi> longed for. It was the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:19686:153"/>
Cooke, and not the cates which that wanton eye affected. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull acts ſeeke for ſecrecy; The company is diſmiſſed, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> only ſtayes; Good meaning ſuſpects nothing; Whiles ſhee preſents the meat ſhe had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to her ſicke brother, her ſelfe is made a pray to his outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious luſt. The modeſt virgin intreats, and perſwades in vain; ſhe layes before him the ſinne, the ſhame, the danger of the fact; and ſince none of theſe can preuaile, faine would win time by the ſuggeſting of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible hopes; Nothing but violence can ſtay a reſolued ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; What he cannot by intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he will haue by force. If the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:19686:153"/>
Diuell were not more ſtrong in men, then nature, they would neuer ſeeke pleaſure in violence. <hi>Amnon</hi> hath no ſooner fulfilled his beaſtly deſires, then he hates <hi>Tamar</hi> more then he loued her. Inordinate luſt neuer ends but in diſcontentment; Loſſe of ſpirits, and remorſe of ſoule make the remembrance of that act tedious, whoſe expectation promiſed delight. If we could ſee the back of ſinfull pleaſures, ere wee behold their face, our harts could not but bee forſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a iuſt deteſtation. Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh <hi>Amnon,</hi> it was thy ſelfe whom thou ſhouldſt haue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this villany; not thine innocent ſiſter; Both of you
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:19686:154"/>
lay together; only one commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted inceſt: What was ſhe but a patient, in that impotent fury of luſt? How vniuſtly doe carnall men miſ-place their affections? No man can ſay whether that loue, or this hatred were more vnreaſonable: Fraud drew <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> into the houſe of <hi>Amnon,</hi> force intertained her within; and droue her out. Faine would ſhe haue hid her ſhame where it was wrought, and may not bee allowed it; That roofe vnder which, ſhee came with honor, and in obedience and loue, may not be lent her for the time as a ſhelter of her ignominy. Neuer any ſauage could be more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous: <hi>Shechem</hi> had rauiſhed
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:19686:154"/>
                     <hi>Dinah,</hi> his offence did not make her odious; his affection ſo continued, that he is willing rather to draw blood of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his people, then forgoe her whom he had abuſed; <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> in one houre is in the exceſſe of loue and hate; and is ſicke of her, for whom he was ſicke; She that lately kept the keyes of his hart, is now lockt out of his doores. Vnruly paſſions runne euer into extremities, and are then beſt apayd, when they are furtheſt off from reaſon and moderation.</p>
                  <p>What could <hi>Amnon</hi> thinke, would be the euent of ſo foule a fact, which as he had not the grace to preuent, ſo he hath not
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:19686:155"/>
the care to conceale? If he lookt not ſo hie as heauen, what could he imagine would follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, but the diſpleaſure of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the danger of law, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of a brother, the ſhame and out-cryes of the world; All which hee might haue hoped to auoyd by ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and plauſible courſes of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. It is the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vpon preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offenders, that they loſe their wit, together with their honeſty; and are either ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they cannot fore-ſee the iſſue of their actions, or ſo beſotted that they doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it.</p>
                  <p>Poore <hi>Thamar</hi> can but bewaile
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:19686:155"/>
that which ſhe could not keepe, her virginty, not loſt, but torne from her by a cruell violence: She rends her princely robe, and layes aſhes on her head, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the ſhame of anothers ſinne; and liues more deſolate then a widdow, in the houſe of her brother <hi>Abſalom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the meane time, what a coroſiue muſt this newes needs be to the heart of good <hi>Dauid,</hi> whoſe fatherly command had out of loue, caſt his daughter into the iawes of this Lyon? What an inſolent affront muſt hee needs conſtrue this, to bee offred by a Sonne to a father; that the father ſhould be made the Pandar of his owne daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:19686:156"/>
to his ſonne? He that lay v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ground weeping for, but the ſicknes of an infant, how vexed doe wee thinke he was with the villany of his heyre, with the rauiſhment of his daughter, both of them worſe then many deaths? What reuenge can he thinke of, for ſo haynous a crime leſſe then death; and what leſſe then death is it to him, to thinke of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge? Rape was by the law of God, capitall, how much more, when it is ſeconded with inceſt? Anger was not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough for ſo hye an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; Yet this is all that I heare of, from ſo indulgent a father, ſauing that he makes vp the reſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19686:156"/>
with ſorrow; puniſhing his ſons outrage in himſelfe; The better-naturd, and more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a man is, the more ſubiect he is to the danger of an ouer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſeneſſe, and the exceſſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and mercy: The milde iniuſtice is no leſſe perilous to the common-wealth, then the cruell.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Dauid</hi> (perhaps out of the conſcience of his owne late of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) will not puniſh this fact, his ſonne <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſhall: not out of any care of iuſtice, but in a deſire of reuenge. Two whole yeares, hath this ſlie Courtier ſmothered his indignation, and fayned kindeneſſe; els his inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Amnon</hi> in ſpeciall, had
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:19686:157"/>
beene ſuſpected. Euen gallant <hi>Abſalom</hi> was a great ſheep-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; The brauery and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of a Courtier, muſt bee built vpon the grounds of fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality; <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe is bidden to this bloody ſheep-ſhearing; It was no otherwiſe meant, but that the fathers eyes, ſhould be the witneſſes, of the tragicall execution of one ſon by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Only <hi>Dauids</hi> loue kept him from that horrible ſpectacle: He is carefull not to be charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that ſon, who cares not to ouer-charge his fathers ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach with a feaſt of blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amnon</hi> hath ſo quite forgot his ſinne, that hee dares goe to feaſt in that houſe where <hi>Tamar</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:19686:157"/>
was mourning; and ſuſpects not the kindenes of him, whom he had deſerued, of a brother to make an enemy; Nothing is more vnſafe to be truſted, then the faire looks of a feſtered hart: Where true charity or iuſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, haue not wrought a ſound reconciliation, malice doth but lurk for the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an aduantage.</p>
                  <p>It was not for nothing, that <hi>Abſalom</hi> deferred his reuenge; which is now ſo much the more exquiſite, as it is longer protracted: What could be more feareful, then when <hi>Amnons</hi> hart was merry with wine, to be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtriken with death? As if this execution had bene no leſſe

                     <hi>Abſalom</hi> deſperate; Fiue yeeres are paſſed, ſince hee ſaw the face of his father; and now he is no leſſe weary of his life, then of this delay; <hi>(Wherefore am I comne downe from Geſhur?

What a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall it bee to the wicked, to be ſhut out for euer, from the preſence of a God, without all poſſible hopes of recouery? This was but a father of the fleſh, by whom, if <hi>Abſalom</hi> liued at firſt, yet in him he liued not, yea,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:19686:164"/>
not without him onely, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him that ſon found hee could liue; God is the Father of Spirits, in whom wee ſo liue, that without him can be no life, no being; to bee euer excluded from him, in whom wee liue and are, what can it be but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall dying, an eternall peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing? If in thy preſence, ô God, be the fulnes of ioy, in thine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, muſt needs be the fulnes of horror and torment; Hide not thy face from vs, ô Lord, but ſhew vs the light of thy countenance, that we may liue, and praiſe thee.</p>
                  <p>Euen the fire of <hi>Ioabs</hi> field, warmed the heart of <hi>Dauid,</hi> whiles it gaue him proofe of the

As a man therefore inwardly weary of ſo long diſpleaſure, at laſt hee receiues <hi>Abſalom</hi> to his ſight, to his fauour; and ſeales his pardon with a kiſſe: Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parents, know not how to retaine an euerlaſting anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fruit of their loynes; how much leſſe ſhall the God of mercies, be vnreconcileably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with his owne; and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his wrath to burne like fire that cannot be quenched? Hee will not alwayes chide, neither will he keepe his anger for euer; His wrath endureth but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his fauour is life; wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping may endure for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning.</p>

                     <hi>Abſalom</hi> is now as great, as faire; beauty and greatneſſe make him proud; pride works his ruine; Great ſpirits will not reſt content with a moderate proſperity: Ere two yeeres bee run out, <hi>Abſalom</hi> runs out into a deſperate plot of rebellion; None but his owne father was aboue him in Iſrael; None was ſo likely, in humane expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſucceed his father; If his ambition could but haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it ſelfe for a few yeeres, (as <hi>Dauid</hi> was now neere his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod) dutifull carrige might haue procured, that by ſucceſſion, which now he ſought by force.

                  <p>The Parents of Chriſt went vp yearely to Ieruſalem at the feaſt of the Paſſouer; the law was onely for the males, I doe not finde the bleſſed virgin bound to this voyage, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſexe receiued indulgence from God: yet ſhee knowing the ſpirituall profit of that iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, takes paines voluntarily to meaſure that long way euery yeare; Piety regards not any diſtinction of ſexes or degrees, nether yet doth Gods acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; rather doth it pleaſe the mercy of the higheſt, more to reward that ſeruice, which, though he like in all, yet out of fauour he will not impoſe vpon
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:19686:175"/>
all! It could not be but that ſhe whom the holy ghoſt ouerſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, ſhould bee zealous of Gods ſeruice: thoſe that will go no further then they are drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their religious exerciſes, are no whit of kinne to her whom all generations ſhall call bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>The childe Ieſus in the mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his age, went vp with his Parents to the holy ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not this yeare onely, but in all likelyhood others alſo; hee in the power of whoſe God-head, and by the motion of whoſe Spirit, all others aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thither, would not himſelfe ſtay at home. In al his examples he meant our Inſtruction: this
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:19686:175"/>
pious act of his nonage inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to lead our firſt yeares into timely deuotion. The firſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor ſeaſons the veſſell for a long time after: It is euery way good for a man, to beare Gods yoke euen from his Infancy: it is the policie of the deuill to diſcourage early holynes: hee that goes out betimes in the morning, is more like to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch his iourney, then he that lingers till the day bee ſpent. This bleſſed Family, came not to looke at the feaſt &amp; be gone; but they duely ſtayd out all the appointed dayes of vnleauened bread: they and the reſt of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael could not want houſhold buſineſſes at home; thoſe ſecular
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:19686:176"/>
affaires could not either keepe them from repayring to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, or ſend them away imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely; Worldly cares muſt giue place to the ſacred: Except wee will depart vnbleſſed, we muſt attend Gods ſeruices till wee may receiue his diſmiſſion:</p>
                  <p>It was the faſhion of thoſe times and places, that they went vp, and ſo returned by troupes, to thoſe ſet meetings of their holy feſtiuals. The whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of Nazareth went and came together, Good-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip doth no way ſo well, as in the paſſage to Heauen: much comfort is added by ſociety to that iourney, which is of it ſelfe pleaſant; It is an happy word,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:19686:176"/>
Come let vs go vp to the houſe of the Lord: Mutual incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is none of the leaſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of our holy aſſemblies: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſticks layd together, make a good fire, which if they lye ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, loſe both their light and heat.</p>
                  <p>The feaſt ended, what ſhould they do, but return to Nazareth? Gods ſeruices may not bee ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as that wee ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect our particular callings: Himſelfe cals vs from his owne houſe to ours: and takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee a painfull Client: They are fouly miſtaken, that thinke God cares for no other trade, but deuotion: Piety &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence muſt keep meet changes
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:19686:177"/>
with each other; neither doth God leſſe acept of our returne to Nazareth, then our going vp to Ieruſalem.</p>
                  <p>I cannot thinke that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, or good <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> could be ſo negligent of their diuine charge, as not to call the childe <hi>Ieſus,</hi> to their ſetting forth from Ieruſalem: But their backe was no ſooner turned vpon the Temple, then his face was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; hee had buſineſſe in that place, when theirs was ended: there hee was both worſhipped and repreſented: hee, in whom the God-head dwelt bodily, could do nothing without God: his true father led him away from his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:19686:177"/>
Sometimes the affaires of our ordinary vocation, may not grudge to yeeld vnto ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall occaſions: The Parents of Chriſt knew him well, to be of a diſpoſition, not ſtrange, nor ſullen and ſtoycall, but ſweet and ſociable: and therfore they ſuppoſed, he had ſpent the time and the way, in the company of their frends and neighbours: They doe not ſuſpect him wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred into the ſolitary fields, but when euening came, they go to ſeeke him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance: If hee had not wonted to conuerſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly with them, hee had not now beene ſought amongſt them: Neither as God, nor man
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:19686:178"/>
doth he take pleaſure in a ſterne froward auſterity, and wilde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiredneſſe: but in a milde affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, and amiable conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p>But, ô bleſſed Virgin, who can expreſſe the ſorrowes of thy perplexed ſoule; when all that euening-ſearch could affoord thee no newes of thy Son <hi>Ieſus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

How didſt thou, with thy care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full husband, ſpend that reſtleſſe

night, in mutuall expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bemonings of your loſſe? How many ſuſpicious imaginations did that while racke thy greeued ſpirit?

Oh deare Sauiour, who can miſſe and not mourne for thee?

that venomous Serpent ſwels with inward poyſon, and haſtes to aſſayle him, whom God hath honored from Heauen.

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:19686:206"/>
darkneſſe? If hee had ſubdued Satan by the almighty power of the deity, wee might haue had what to wonder at, not what to imitate; now hee vſeth that weapon, which may be familiar vnto vs, that he may teach our weakeneſſe how to be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; Nothing in heauen or earth can beat the forces of hell, but the word of God; How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhould wee furniſh our ſelues with this powerfull mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; how ſhould our hearts and mouthes bee full of it? <hi>Teach mee O Lord the way of thy ſtatutes; O take not from mee the words of Truth; Let them bee my ſongs in the houſe of my pilgrimage; So ſhall I make anſwer to my blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers.</hi>

without the concurrence of whoſe prouidence, bread would rather choke, then nouriſh vs; Let him withdrawe his hand from his creature; in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt abundance we periſh; Why doe we therefore bend our eyes on the meanes, and not looke vp to the hand that giues the bleſſing?</p>
                  <p>What ſo neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance hath the bleſſing vpon the creature, if our ptayers hold them not together; As we may not neglect the meanes, ſo wee may not neglect the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a bleſſing vpon the meanes, nor bee vnthankefull to the hand that hath giuen the bleſſing.</p>

In the firſt aſſault, Satan moues Chriſt to doubt of his fathers prouidence, and to vſe vnlawfull meanes to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: in the next, he moues him to preſume vpon his Fathers protection, and the ſeruice of his bleſſed Angels; He grounds the firſt vpon a conceit of want, the next of abundance; If he be in extremes, it is all to one end, to miſlead vnto euill: If wee cannot be driuen downe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, he labours to lift vs vp to preſumption; It is not one foile that can put this bold ſpirit out of countenance: Tentations, like waues, breake one in the necke of another; Whiles wee are in this warre-fare, wee
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:19686:208"/>
muſt make account, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of one tentation doth but inuite another.</p>
                  <p>That bleſſed Sauiour of ours, that was content to be led from lordan into the wildernes, for the aduantage of the firſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, yeelds to be led from the wilderneſſe to Ieruſalem, for the aduantage of the ſecond; The place doth not a little auaile to the act: The wilderneſſe was fit for a tentation, arifing from want, it was not fit for a tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mouing to vain-glory. The populous City was the fitteſt for ſuch a motion; Ieruſalem was the glory of the world, the Temple was the glory of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, the pinacles, the higheſt
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:19686:209"/>
peece of the Temple, there is Chriſt content to be ſet for the opportunity of tentation: O Sauiour of men, how can wee wonder enough at this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of thine, that thou wouldſt ſo farre abaſe thy ſelfe, as to ſuffer thy pure and ſacred body to bee tranſported by the preſumptuous and malicious hand of that vnchaſte ſpirit? It was not his power, it was thy patience, that deſerues our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, Neither can this ſeem ouer-ſtrange to vs, when wee conſider, that if Satan bee the head of wicked men, wicked men are the members of Satan; What was <hi>Pilate,</hi> or the Iewes that perſecuted thine innocence,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:19686:209"/>
but lims of this Diuell? and why are we then amazed, to ſee thee touched, and locally tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported by the head, when wee ſee thee yeelding thy ſelfe ouer, to be crucified by the members? If Satan did the worſe, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, mediately by their hands, no maruell if hee doe the leſſe and eaſier, immediately by his own, yet neither of them without thy voluntary diſpenſation. Hee could not haue looked at thee, without thee; And if the Son of God, did thus ſuffer his owne holy and precious body, to bee carried by Satan, what wonder is it, if that Enemy haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times power giuen him, ouer the ſinfull bodies of the adopted
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:19686:210"/>
Sons of God. It is not the ſtrength of faith, that can ſecure vs from the outward violences of that euill One; This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I finde betwixt his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and bodily aſſaults: thoſe are beaten backe by the ſhield of faith, theſe admit not of ſuch repulſe; As the beſt man may bee lame, blinde, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, ſo through the permiſſion of God, he may be bodily vexed by that olde Man-ſlayer; Grace was neuer giuen vs for a target againſt externall afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Me thinkes I ſee Chriſt, hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp on the higheſt battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Temple; whoſe very roofe was an hundred and thirty cubits high; and Satan
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:19686:210"/>
ſtanding by him with this ſpeech in his mouth; Well then, ſince in the matter of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou wilt needes depend vpon thy Fathers prouidence, that he can without meanes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine thee, take now further tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of that prouidence, in thy miraculous preſeruation; Caſt thy ſelfe down from this height; Behold, thou art here in Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, the famous and holy City of the world; here thou art, on the top of the pinacle of that Temple, which is dedicated to thy Father, and, if thou be God, to thy ſelfe; the eyes of all men are now fixt vpon thee, there cannot be deuiſed a more ready way to ſpred thy glory, and to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:19686:211"/>
proclaime thy Deity, then by caſting thy ſelfe headlong to the earth. All the world will ſay, there is more in thee, then a man; and for danger, there can bee none; What can hurt him, that is the Son of God? and wherefore ſerues that glorious Guard of Angels, which haue by diuine commiſſion, taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the charge of thine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity? ſince therefore in one act, thou mayſt bee both ſafe, and celebrated, truſt thy Father, and thoſe thy ſeruiceable ſpirits with thine aſſured preſeruation, <hi>Caſt thy ſelfe downe:</hi> And why didſt thou not, ô thou malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirit, endeauour to caſt downe my Sauiour, by thoſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:19686:211"/>
ſame preſumptuous hands, that brought him vp, ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent is more eaſie then the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp? was it for that, it had not beene ſo great an aduantage to thee, that hee ſhould fall by thy meanes, as by his owne? falling into ſinne, was more then to fall from the pinacle; ſtill thy care and ſute is, to make vs Authours to our ſelues of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; thou gaineſt nothing by our bodily hurt; if the ſoule be ſafe: Or was it rather for that, thou couldſt not? I doubt not, but thy malice could as well haue ſerued, to haue offered this meaſure to himſelfe, as to his holy Apoſtle ſoone after; but he that bounded thy power,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:19686:212"/>
tether'd thee ſhorter; Thou couldſt not, thou canſt not doe what thou wouldſt. Hee that would permit thee to carry him vp, binds thy hands from caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him downe: And wo were it for vs if thou wert not euer ſtinted:</p>
                  <p>Why did Satan carry vp Chriſt ſo high, but on purpoſe, that his fall might bee the more deadly; ſo deales hee ſtill with vs, he exalts vs, that we may be dangerouſly abaſed; Hee puffs men vp with ſwelling thoughts of their owne worthineſſe, that they may bee vile in the eyes of God, and fall into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: It is the manner of God, to caſt downe, that he may raiſe, to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:19686:212"/>
abaſe that he may exalt; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, Satan raiſes vp, that hee may throw downe, and intends nothing but our deiection, in our aduancement.</p>
                  <p>Height of place giues oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of tentation; Thus buſie is that wicked one, in working againſt the members of Chriſt. If any of them bee in eminence aboue others, thoſe hee labours moſt to ruinate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They had need to ſtand faſt, that ſtand high; Both there is more danger of their falling, and more hurt in their fall.</p>
                  <p>Hee that had preſumed thus far, to tempt the Lord of life, would faine now draw him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to preſume vpon his Deity;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:19686:213"/>
                     <hi>If thou bee the Son of God, cast thy ſelfe downe.</hi> There is not a more tryed ſhaft in all his quiuer, then this; a perſwaſion to men, not to beare themſelues too bold vpno the fauor of God; Thou art the Elect and Redemed of God; ſin, becauſe grace hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, ſin, that it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound; Thou art ſafe enough, though thou offend, be not too much an aduerſary to thine owne liberty: Falſe Spirit, it is no liberty to ſin, but ſeruitude rather, there is no liberty, but in the freedome from ſin; Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of vs, that hath the hope of Sonnes, muſt purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, euen as hee is pure, that hath redeemed vs: Wee are
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:19686:213"/>
bought with a price, therefore muſt wee glorifie God in our bodies and ſpirits, for they are Gods; Our Son-ſhip teacheth vs awe and obedience, and therefore, becauſe we are Sons, we will not caſt our ſelues downe into ſin.</p>
                  <p>How idly doe Satan and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men meaſure God, by the crooked line of their owne miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit: Ywis, Chriſt cannot be the Son of God, vnleſſe hee caſt himſelfe downe from the pinacle; vnleſſe he come down from the Croſſe. God is not mercifull, vnles he humor them in all their deſires, not iuſt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee take ſpeedy vengeance, where they require it; But when
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:19686:214"/>
they haue ſpent their folly vpon theſe vaine imaginations, Chriſt is the Son of God, though hee ſtay on the top of the Temple, God will bee mercifull, though wee miſcarry, and iuſt, though Sinners ſeeme lawleſſe. Neither will he be any other then he is, or meaſured by any rule, but himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But what is this I ſee, Satan himſelfe with a Bible vnder his arme, with a Text in his mouth, <hi>It is written, He ſhall giue his Angels charge ouer thee?</hi> How ſtill in that wicked One doth ſubtilty ſtriue with preſumption? Who could not, but ouer-wonder at this, if hee did not conſider, that ſince the Deuill dared to touch the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:19686:214"/>
ſacred bódy of Chriſt with his hand, hee may well touch the Scriptures of God with his tongue? Let no man hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth maruell, to heare heretikes, or hypocrites, quote Scriptures, when Satan himſelfe hath not ſpared to cite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; what are they the worſe for this, more then that holy body, which he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported? Some haue been poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, by their meats &amp; drinks, yet either theſe nouriſh vs, or nothing: It is not the letter of the Scripture that can carry it, but the ſence; if we diuide theſe two, wee prophane and abuſe that word wee alledge. And wherfore doth this foule Spirit vrgea Text, but for imitation,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:19686:215"/>
for preuention, and for ſucceſſe? Chriſt had alledged a Scripture vnto him, hee re-alledges Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vnto Chriſt: At leaſt wiſe, he will counterfet an imitation of the Son of God; Neither is it in this alone; what one act euer paſſed the hand of God, which Satan did not apiſhly attempt to ſecond? If we follow Chriſt in the outward action, with contrary intentions, wee follow Satan, in following Chriſt. Or, perhaps, Satan meant to make Chriſt hereby weery of this weapon; As wee ſee faſhions, when they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp of the vnworthy. are caſt of by the great, It was doubtles, one cauſe, why Chriſt
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:19686:215"/>
afterwards forbad the Diuell euen to confeſſe the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe his mouth was a ſlander. But chiefely doth he this, for a better colour of his tentation: He guilds ouer this falfe mettall with Scripture, that it may paſſe currant; Euen now is Satan transformed into an Angel of light, and will ſeeme godly for a miſcheife; If hypocrites make a faire ſhow to deceiue with a glorious luſtre of holineſſe, we ſee whence they borrowd it: How many thouſand ſoules are betrayd by the abuſe of that word, whoſe vſe is ſoueraigne and ſauing. No diuell is ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as the religious diuell. If good meate turne to the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:19686:216"/>
not of nature, but of the diſeaſe, we may not forbeare to feed, but indeauour to purge the body of thoſe euill humors, which cauſe the ſtomach to worke againſt it ſelfe. O God, thou that haſt giuen vs light, giue vs cleare and ſound eyes, that we may take comfort of that light thou haſt giuen vs; Thy word is holy, make our hearts ſo, and then ſhall they finde that word, not more true then cordiall; Let not this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine table of thine, bee made a ſnare to our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>What can be a better act then to ſpeake Scripture? It were a wonder if Satan ſhould doe a good thing well; He cites ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:19686:216"/>
then, but with mutilation, and diſtortion; it comes not out of his mouth, but maymed and peruerted; One peece is left out, all miſapplyed; Thoſe that wreſt or mangle Scripture for their owne turne, it is eaſie to ſee from what ſchoole they come. Let vs take the word from the author, not from the vſurper: <hi>Dauid</hi> would not doubt to eate that ſheep, which hee pulled out of the mouth of the Beare or Lyon; <hi>(Hee ſhall giue his Angels charge ouer thee:)</hi> Oh comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſurance of our protection; Gods children neuer goe vnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; Like vnto great Princes we walke euer in the midſt of our guard; though inuiſible,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:19686:217"/>
yet true, carefull, powerfull; What creatures are ſo glorious as the Angels of heauen, yet their maker hath ſet them to ſerue vs: Our adoption makes vs at once great and ſafe; Wee may be contemptible and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious in the eyes of the world, but the Angels of God obſerue vs the while, and ſcorne not to wait vpon vs in our homelieſt occaſions; The Sun, or the light may wee keepe out of our houſes, the ayre we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; much leſſe theſe fpirits, that are more ſimple and immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: No walls, no bolts, can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them from our ſides: they accompany vs in dungeons, they goe with vs into our exile;
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:19686:217"/>
How can wee either feare dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or complaine of ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whiles we haue ſo vnſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſo glorious companions?</p>
                  <p>Is our Sauiour diſtaſted with Scripture, becauſe Satan miſlaies it in his diſh? Doth he not rather ſnatch this ſword out of that impure hand, and beat Satan with the weapon which hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth; <hi>(It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt thy Lord thy God;)</hi> The Scripture is one, as that God, whoſe it is; Where it carryes an appearance of difficulty or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, it needs no light to cleare it, but that, which it hath in it ſelfe. All doubts that may ariſe from it, are fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by collection; It is true
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:19686:218"/>
that God hath taken this care, and giuen this charge of his owne; he will haue them kept, not in their ſinnes; they may truſt him, they may not tempt him; hee meant to incourage their faith, not their preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To caſt our ſelues vpon an immediate prouidence, when meanes faile not, is to diſobey, in ſteed of beleeuing God; we may challenge God on his word, we may not ſtraine him beyond it; wee may make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what he promiſed, we may not ſubiect his promiſes to vniuſt examinations; and where no need is, make triall of his power, iuſtice, mercie, by deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our owne. All the Diuels
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:19686:218"/>
in hel, could not elude the force of this diuine anſwer; and now Satan ſees how vainely he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth Chriſt to tempt God.</p>
                  <p>Yet againe for all this, doe I ſee him ſetting vpon the Son of God: Satan is not foyled when he is reſiſted: neither diffidence, nor preſumption can faſten vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, he ſhall be tryed with honor; As ſome expert Fencer that challenges at all weapons, ſo doth this great enemy; In vaine ſhall we plead our skill in ſome, if we faile in any; It muſt be our wiſdome to be prepared for all kinde of aſſaults: As thoſe that hold townes and forts doe, not only defend themſelues from incurſions, but from the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:19686:219"/>
cannon and the Pioner; ſtill doth that ſubtil Serpent trauerſe his ground for an aduantage; The Temple is not hye enough for his next tentation; He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carryes vp Chriſt to the top of an exceeding high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; All enemies in pitcht fields ſtriue for the benefit of the hill, or riuer, or winde, or ſunne; That which his ſeruant <hi>Balac</hi> did by his inſtigation, himſelfe doth now immediately, change places in hope of preuailing. If the obſcure country will not moue vs, hee tries what the Court can do, if not our home, the Tauerne, if not the field, our cloſet,; As no place is left free by his malice, ſo no place muſt
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:19686:219"/>
be made preiudiciall by our careleſneſſe; and as wee ſhould alwayes watch ouer our ſelues, ſo then moſt, when the oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity carries cauſe of ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore is Chriſt caryed vp ſo high but for proſpect? If the kingdomes of the earth and their glory, were only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to his imagination; the valley would haue ſerued; If to the outward ſence, no hill could ſuffice; Circular bodyes though ſmal, cannot be ſeene at once. This ſhow was made to both, diuers kingdomes lying round about Iudea were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the eye; The glory of them to the imagination; Satan meant the eye could tempt the
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:19686:220"/>
fancy; no leſſe then the fancy could tempt the will. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand ſoules haue dyed of the wound of the eye; If we doe not let in ſinne at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the eye, or the dore of the eare, it cannot enter into our hearts.</p>
                  <p>If there bee any pompe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty, pleaſure, brauery in the world, where ſhould it be but in the Courts of Princes, whom God hath made his Images, his deputies vpon earth? There is ſoft rayment, ſumptuous feaſts, rich Iewels, honorable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, glorious triumphs, roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtate, theſe Satan laies out to the faireſt ſhow: But oh the craft of that old Serpent; Many
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:19686:220"/>
a care attends greatneſſe; No creature is without thornes: High ſeats are neuer but vnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; all thoſe infinite diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the ſhaddow of earthly ſoueraignety, he hides out of the way; nothing may bee ſeene, but what may both pleaſe and allure. Satan is ſtill and euer like himſelfe; If tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be but turnd about and ſhowne on both ſides, the kingdome of darkneſſe would not be ſo populous. Now when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Tempter ſets vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poore ſoule, all ſting of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, wrath, iudgement, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is concealed, as if they were not; Nothing may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the eye but pleaſure,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:19686:221"/>
profit, and a ſeeming happineſſe in the inioying our deſires; thoſe other wofull obiects are reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the farewell of ſinne; that our miſery may bee ſeene and felt at once; When we are once ſure, Satan is a Tyrant, till then, he is a Paraſite: There can be no ſafety, if we do not view as well the backe as the face of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>But oh preſumption and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, that hell it ſelfe may be aſham'd of; The Diuell dares ſay to Chriſt, <hi>All theſe will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip mee;</hi> That beggerly ſpirit, that hath not an inch of earth, can offer the whole world to the maker; to the owner of it;
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:19686:221"/>
The ſlaue of God would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dord of his Creator; How can we hope he ſhould be ſparing of falſe boaſts, and of vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble promiſes vnto vs, when hee dares offer kingdomes to him by whom kings raigne?</p>
                  <p>Tentations on the right hand are moſt dangerous; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that haue bene hardned with feare, haue melted with honor; There is no doubt of that ſoule that will not bite at the golden hooke.</p>
                  <p>Falſe lyers and vaineglorious boaſters, ſee the top of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree; If I may not rather ſay, that Satan doth borrow the vſe of their tongues for a time; Whereas faithfull is he that hath
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:19686:222"/>
promiſed; who will alſo doe it. Fidelity and truth is the iſſue of heauen.</p>
                  <p>If Idolatry were not a deare ſinne to Satan, he would not be ſo importunate to compaſſe it; It is miſerable to ſee how hee drawes the world inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſin, which they profeſſe to deteſt; Thoſe that would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hazard the furnace, then worſhip gold in a ſtatue, yet doe adore it in the ſtampe, and finde no fault with themſelues. If our hearts be drawne to ſtoope vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an ouer-high reſpect of any creature, wee are Idolaters. O God, it is no maruell if thy ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie be kindled at the admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any of thine owne works
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:19686:222"/>
into a competition of honor with their Creator.</p>
                  <p>Neuer did our Sauiour ſay, <hi>Auoid Satan,</hi> till now; It is a iuſt indignation, that is conceiued at the motion of a riuality with God, Neither yet did Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his diuine power in this command, but by the neceſſary force of Scripture, driues away that impure Tempter; <hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerue:</hi> The reſt of our Sauiours an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers were more full and direct, then that they could admit of a reply, but this was ſo flat and abſolute, that it vtterly daunted the courage of Satan, and put him to a ſhamefull flight, and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:19686:223"/>
made him for the time, weary of his trade.</p>
                  <p>The way to bee rid of the troubleſome ſolicitations of that wicked one, is continued reſiſtance. Hee that forcibly droue the tempter from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, takes him off from vs, and will not abide his aſſaults per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pctuall; It is our exerciſe and triall, that hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, not our confuſion.</p>

                  <p>I ſee the people, not onely following Chriſt, but preſſing

                  <p>The throng of Auditors for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſt to leaue the ſhore, and to make <hi>Peters</hi> ſhip his Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit;

Neuer were there ſuch nets caſt out of that fiſher-boat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; whiles hee was vpon the land, he healed the ſicke bodies by his touch; now that he was vpon the ſea, he cured the ſicke ſoules by his doctrine; and is purpoſely ſeuered from the multitude, that hee may vnite them to him. Hee that made both ſea and land, cauſeth both of them to conſpire to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of doing good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon</hi> was buſie, waſhing his nets: Euen thoſe nets that caught nothing, muſt bee wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, no leſſe then if they had ſped well: The nights toyle doth not excuſe his dayes work: Little did <hi>Simon</hi> thinke of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

thoſe nets, which hee ſo carefully waſhed; and now Chriſt interrupts him with the fauour and bleſſing of his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence; Labour in our callings (how homely ſoeuer) makes vs capable of diuine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction.</p>
                  <p>The honeſt Fiſher-man, when hee ſaw the people flocke after Chriſt, and heard him ſpeake with ſuch power, could not but conceiue a generall &amp; confuſe apprehenſion of ſome excellent worth in ſuch a Teacher, and therefore is glad to honour his ſhip with ſuch a gueſt; and is firſt Chriſts hoſt by ſea, ere hee is his Diſciple by land; An hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſeruiceable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:19686:226"/>
of a Prophet of God, was a good foundation of his future honour; Hee that would ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily lend Chriſt his hand, and his ſhip, was likely ſoone after to beſtow himſelfe vpon his Sauiour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Simon</hi> hath no ſooner done this ſeruice to Chriſt, then Chriſt is preparing for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; when the ſermon is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the ſhip-roome ſhall bee payd for abundantly; Neither ſhall the Hoſt expect any other pay-maſter then himſelfe: <hi>Lanch forth into the deepe, and let downe your nets to make a draught:</hi> That ſhip which lent Chriſt an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of catching men vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſhore, ſhall bee requited

with a plentifull draught of fiſh in the deepe: It had beene as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for our Sauiour, to haue brought the fiſh to <hi>Peters</hi> ſhip, cloſe to the ſhore, yet as chuſing rather to haue the ſhip carried to the ſhole of fiſh, hee bids <hi>(Lanch forth into the deep:)</hi> In his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, hee loues euer to meet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her bounds; and when ſhe hath done her beſt, to ſupply the reſt by his ouer-ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; The ſame power therefore, that could haue cauſed the fiſhes to leap vpon dry land, or to leaue themſelues forſaken of the waters, vpon the ſands of the Lake, will rather finde them in a place naturall to their abiding <hi>(Lanch out into the deepe.)</hi>

Rather in a deſire to gratifie and obey his gueſt, then to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe, will <hi>Simon</hi> beſtow one caſt of his net; Had Chriſt enioyned him an harder taske, he had not refuſed; yet not without an allegation of the vnlikelyhood of ſucceſſe, <hi>(Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter wee haue trauailed all night, and caught nothing; yet at thy word I will let downe the net.</hi>

                  <p>It was not meere retribution that was intended in this euent, but inſtruction alſo: This act was not without a miſtery; He that ſhould be made a fiſher of men, ſhall in this draught fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee his ſucceſſe; The kingdome of heauen is like a draw-net, caſt into the ſea, which when it is full men draw to land; The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt draught that <hi>Peter</hi> made after the complement of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip, incloſed no leſſe then three thouſand ſoules.

The bleſſed virgin knew to whom ſhe ſued; She had good reaſon to know the diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and power of her Sonne: Perhaps the Bride-groome was not ſo needy, but if not by his purſe, yet by his credit, he might haue ſupplyed that want; or, it were hard if ſome of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-gueſts (had they bene du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolicited) might not haue furniſhed him with ſo much wine, as might ſuffice for the laſt ſeruice of a dinner; but bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> knew a nearer way; ſhe did not thinke beſt to lade at the ſhallow channell, but runs rather to the well-head, where ſhe may dip, and fill the

that honour, which is ſtolne from thy Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>There is a marriage, whereto we are inuited, yea, wherein we are already intereſſed, not as the gueſts only, but as the Bride; in which there ſhall be no want of the wine of gladneſſe: It is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, if in theſe earthly banquets there be not ſome lacke; In thy preſence, ô Sauiour, there is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ioy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for euermore.

                  <p>Euen in that rough anſwer, doth the bleſſed Virgin deſcry cauſe of hope. If his houre were not yet comne, it was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:19686:240"/>
comming; when the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the gueſts, and the neceſſity of the occaſion had made fit roome for the miracle, it ſhall come forth, &amp; challenge their wonder. Faithfully there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and obſeruantly, doth ſhee turne her ſpeech from her Son to the Wayters <hi>(Whatſoeuer hee ſaith vnto you, doe it.)</hi> How well doth it beſeeme the mother of Chriſt to agree with his Father in Heauen, whoſe voyce from Heauen ſayd, <hi>This is my welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Son, heare him;</hi> She that ſayd of her ſelfe, <hi>Be it vnto mee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy word,</hi> ſaies vnto others, <hi>Whatſoeuer hee ſaith to you, doe it.</hi> This is the way to haue miracles wrought in vs, obedience to his
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:19686:240"/>
Word. The power of Chriſt did not ſtand vpon their officiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; he could haue wrought wonders in ſpite of them; but their peruerſe refuſall of his commands, might haue made them vncapable of the fauour of a miraculous action: Hee that can (when hee will) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the obſtinate, will not grace the diſobedient. Hee that could worke without vs, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, will not worke for vs, but by vs.</p>
                  <p>This very poore houſe, was furniſhed with many and large veſſels, for outward purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; As if ſin had dwelt vpon the skin, that ſuperſtitious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſought holineſſe in frequent
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:19686:241"/>
waſhings; Euen this rinſing fouled them, with the vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a traditionall will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It is the ſoule which needs ſcouring; and nothing can waſh that, but the bloud, which they deſperately wiſhed vpon themſelues, and their children; for guilt, not for expiation. Purge thou vs, ô Lord, with hyſſop, and we ſhall bee cleane, waſh vs and we ſhall be whiter then ſnow.</p>
                  <p>The wayters could not but thinke ſtrange of ſo vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a command; <hi>(Fill the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots.)</hi> It is wine that wee want, what doe we go to fetch water; Doth this holy man mean thus to quench our feaſt, and coole
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:19686:241"/>
our ſtomachs? If there bee no remedy, wee could haue ſought this ſupply vnbidden; yet ſo far hath the charge of Chriſts mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preuailed, that in ſteede of carrying flagons of wine to the table, they goe to fetch pailes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of water from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes. It is no pleading of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelyhoods againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an Almighty power.</p>
                  <p>Hee that could haue created wine immediately in thoſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, will rather turne water into wine; In all the courſe of his mitacles, I doe neuer finde him making out of nothing; all his great workes are grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on former exiſtences; he mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed the bread, hee changed
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:19686:242"/>
the water, he reſtored the withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lims, hee rayſed the dead; and ſtill wrought vpon that which was, and did not make that which was not: What doth he in the ordinary way of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but turne the watery iuyce that ariſes vp from the root, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wine; he will onely doe this now ſuddenly, and at once, which he doth vſually by inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible degrees. It is euer duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the Son of God, not to doe more miracle then hee needes.</p>
                  <p>How liberall are the prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt? If he had turned but one of thoſe veſſels, it had beene a iuſt proofe of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and perhaps that quantity
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:19686:242"/>
had ſerued the preſent neceſſity; now hee furniſheth them with ſo much wine, as would haue ſerued an hundred and fifty gueſts for an intire ſeaſt; Euen the meaſure magnifies at once, both his power and mercy. The munificent hand of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not our neede onely, but our honeſt affluence: It is our ſin and our ſhame, if wee turne his fauour into wantonneſſe. There muſt be firſt a filling, ere there be a drawing out: Thus, in our veſſels, the firſt care muſt be of our receit; the next, of our expence: God would haue vs ciſternes, not channels.</p>
                  <p>Our Sauiour would not bee his owne taſter, but he ſends the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:19686:243"/>
firſt draught to the Gouernour of the feaſt. He knew his own power, they did not; Neither would he beare witnes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but fetch it out of others mouthes; They that knew not the originall of that wine, yet prayſed the taſte; <hi>(Euery man at the beginning, doth ſet forth good wine, and when men haue well drunk, then that which is worſe, but thou haſt kept the good wine vntill now;)</hi> The ſame bounty that expreſſed it ſelfe in the quantity of the wine, ſhewes it ſelfe no leſſe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence: Nothing can fall from that diuine hand not exquiſite: That liberality hated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide crab-wine for his gueſts. It was fit, that the miraculous
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:19686:243"/>
effects of Chriſt, (which came from his immediate hand) ſhould be more perfect, then the naturall. O bleſſed Sauiour, how delicate is that new wine, which we ſhall one day drinke with thee, in thy Fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Thou ſhalt turne this water of our earthly affliction, into that wine of gladneſſe, wherewith our ſoules ſhall bee ſatiate for euer. Make haſte, ô my Beloued, and bee thou like to a Roe, or to a young Hart, vpon the mountaine of ſpices.</p>

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:19686:244"/>
Hee loued that Nation, which was choſen of God; and if hee were not of the Synagogue, yet he built a Synagogue; where hee might not bee a Party, hee would be a Benefactor; Next to being good, is a fauouring of goodneſſe; We could not loue religion, if we vtterly wanted it: How many true Iewes were not ſo zealous? Either will, or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity lacked in them, whom duty more obliged; Good affections doe many times more then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply nature: Neither doth God regard whence, but what wee are.</p>
                  <p>I doe not ſee this Centurion come to Chriſt, as the Iſraelitiſh Captaine came to <hi>Elias</hi> in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:19686:245"/>
but with his cap in his hand, with much ſuit, much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by others, by himſelfe; He ſends firſt the Elders of the lewes, whom hee might hope, that their nation &amp; place, might make gracious: then, leſt the imployment of others might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue neglect, he ſeconds them in perſon; Cold and fruitleſſe are the motions of frends, where wee doe wilfully ſhut vp our owne lips: Importunity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſpeede well in both. Could wee but ſpeake for our ſoules, as this Captaine did for his ſeruant, what could we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly want? What maruell is it, if God bee not forward to giue, where wee care not to aske; or
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:19686:245"/>
aske, as if wee cared not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue? Shall wee yet call this a ſuit, or a complaint? I heare no one word of entreaty; The leſſe is ſayd, the more is concealed, It is enough to lay open his wants; He knew well, that hee had to deale with ſo wiſe and mercifull a Phyſician, as that the opening of the malady was a crauing of cure: If our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall miſeries bee but confeſſed, they cannot faile of redreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Great variety of Suitors reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt; One comes to him for a ſon, another for a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a third for himſelfe: I ſee none come for his ſeruant, but this one Centurion; Neither was hee a better man then a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:19686:246"/>
His ſeruant is ſicke; hee doth not driue him out of doores, but layes him at home; neither doth he ſtand gazing by his beds-ſide, but ſeekes forth; He ſeekes forth, not to Witches, or Charmers, but to Chriſt; he ſeekes to Chriſt, not with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable relation, but with a vehement aggrauation of the diſeaſe. Had the Maſter beene ſicke, the faithfulleſt ſeruant could haue done no more: He is vnworthy to bee well ſerued, that will not ſomtimes wait vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his followers. Conceits of inferiority, may not breed in vs a neglect of charitable offices; ſo muſt we look downe vpon our ſeruants, here on earth, as that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:19686:246"/>
wee muſt ſtill looke vp to our Maſter, which is in heauen.</p>
                  <p>But why didſt thou not, ô Centurion, rather bring thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to Chriſt for cure, then ſue for him abſent? There was a Paralytick, whom faith and charity brought to our Sauiour, and let downe thorow the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered roofe, in his bed; why was not thine ſo carried, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented? Was it out of the ſtrength of thy faith, which aſſured thee, thou needeſt not ſhew thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to him, that ſaw all things?

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:19686:247"/>
thou beleeued it; Their act argued no leſſe deſire, thine, more confidence; Thy labour was leſſe, becauſe thy faith was more: Oh, that I could come thus to my Sauiour, and make ſuch mone to him for my ſelfe: Lord, my ſoule is ſicke of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, ſicke of ſelfe-loue, ſicke of inordinate deſires, I ſhould not neede to ſay more; Thy mercy, ô Sauiour, would not then ſtay for my ſuit, but would preuent me (as here) with a gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, <hi>I will come and heale thee;</hi> I did not heare the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion ſay, <hi>Either come, or heale him;</hi> The one he meant, though hee ſayd not, the other, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayd, nor meant: Chriſt

miracle; He ſaies hee is vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Chriſts preſence: There is great difference betwixt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers valuations, and our owne; Sometimes the world vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates him that findes reaſon to ſet an high price vpon himſelfe; Somtimes againe, it ouer-values a man that knowes iuſt cauſe of his owne humiliation; If others miſtake vs, this can be no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for our error; Wee cannot be wiſe, vnleſſe wee receiue the knowledge of our ſelues by direct beames, not by reflection; vnleſſe we haue learned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne vniuſt applauſes; and ſcorning the flatteryes of the world, to frowne vpon our owne vileneſſe, <hi>Lord I am not worthy.</hi>

Many a one if he had bene in the Centurions cote, would haue thought well of it; A Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, a man of good ability and command, a founder of a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, a Patron of religion: yet he ouerlookes all theſe, and when he caſts his eye vpon the diuine worth of Chriſt, and his owne weakeneſſe, he ſaies, <hi>I am not worthy; Alas Lord I am a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, an alien, a man of blood, thou art holy, thou art omnipotent.</hi> True humility will teach vs to finde out the beſt of another, and the worſt peece of our ſelues; Pride contrarily ſhowes vs nothing, but matter of admiration in our ſelues; in others, of contempt. Whiles hee confeſt himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:19686:250"/>
of any fauour; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued himſelfe worthy of all. Had not Chriſt bene before in his heart, hee could not haue thought himſelfe vnworthy to intertaine that gueſt within his houſe; Vnder the low roofe of an humble breſt, doth God euer delight to dwel; The ſtare of his Pallace may not bee meaſured by the height, but by the depth: Brags &amp; bold faces do oft-times carry it away with men, nothing preuailes with God, but our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary deiections.</p>
                  <p>It is fit the foundations ſhould be laid deep, where the building is high; The centurions humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was not more lowe; then his faith was lofty; that reaches

There needs no footing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue mountaines, or Deuills, but a word; Doe but ſay the word, ô Sauiour, my ſinne ſhall be remitted; my ſoule ſhall bee

                  <p>Whereupon then was the ſteddy confidence of the Good Centurion?

<pb n="488" facs="tcp:19686:252"/>
drop of water we may ſee what is in the maine Ocean; I maruell not if the Centurion were kinde to his ſeruants, for they were dutifull to him; he can but ſay, <hi>Doe this,</hi> and it is done; theſe mutuall reſpects draw on each other; cheerefull and diligent ſeruice in the one, calls for a due and fauourable care in the other; they that neglect to pleaſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not complaine to bee neglected.</p>
                  <p>Oh that I could be but ſuch a ſeruant to mine heauenly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; Alas, euery of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſayes, <hi>Doe this,</hi> and I doe it not; Euery of his inhibitions ſayes, <hi>Doe it not,</hi> and I doe it, He ſayes, <hi>Goe from the world,</hi> I run to it; he ſayes, <hi>Come to mee,</hi> I runne
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:19686:252"/>
from him: Woe is mee, this is not ſeruice, but enmity; how can I looke for fauour, whiles I returne rebellion; It is a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maſter whom wee ſerue; there can bee no duty of ours, that he ſees not, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges not, that he crownes not; we could not but be happy, if we could be officious.</p>
                  <p>What can be more maruelous then to ſee Chriſt maruell? All maruelling ſuppoſes an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance going before, and a knowledge following ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident vnexpected: now who wrought this faith in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, but he that wondred at it? Hee knew well what hee wrought, becauſe hee wrought
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:19686:253"/>
what he would; yet he wondred at what he both wrought, and knew, to teach vs, much more to admire that which hee at once knowes and holds admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Hee wrought this faith as God, he wondred at it as man; God wrought, and man admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he that was both, did both; to teach vs where to beſtow our wonder. I neuer finde Chriſt wondring at gold, or ſiluer, at the coſtly and curious workes of humane skill or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; Yea, when the Diſciples wondred at the magnificence of the Temple, he rebuked them rather: I finde him not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at the frame of heauen
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:19686:253"/>
and earth, nor at the orderly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all creatures and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents; the familiarity of theſe things intercepts the admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But when he ſees the grace or acts of faith, he ſo approues them, that he is rauiſhed with wonder; Hee that reioyced in the view of his creation, to ſee that of nothing, he had made all things good, reioyces no leſſe in the reformation of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſee, that hee hath made good of euill: Behold thou art faire, my loue, behold thou art faire, and there is no ſpot in thee; My ſiſter, my ſpouſe, thou haſt wounded my heart, thou haſt wounded my heart with one of thine eyes.</p>

Our wealth, beauty, wit, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, honor may make vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of men, but it is our faith only, that ſhall make God in loue with vs; And why are we of any other ſaue Gods diet, to bee more affected with the leaſt meaſure of grace in any man, then withall the outward glories of the world? There are great men whom we iuſtly pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we can admire none but the gracious.</p>
                  <p>Neither was that plant more worthy of wonder in it ſelfe, then that it grew in ſuch a ſoyle, with ſo little help of raine and Sun; The weakneſſe of meanes, addes to the prayſe and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our proficiency: To do
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:19686:254"/>
good vpon a little is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of thrift; it is ſmall thanke to bee full-handed in a large eſtate; As contrarily, the ſtrength of meanes doubles the reuenge of our neglect: It is not more the ſhame of Iſrael, then the glory of the Centurion, that our Sauiour ſayes, <hi>I haue not found ſo great faith in Iſrael;</hi> Had Iſrael yeelded any equal faith, it could not haue beene vneſpyed of thoſe all-ſeeing eyes; yet were their helps ſo much greater, then their faith was leſſe; and God neuer giues more then hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires: Where we haue laid our tillage, and compoſt, and ſeed, who would not looke for a crop? but if the vncultured fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
